It consists of 836 islands grouped into two island groups, the northern Andaman Islands and the southern Nicobar Islands, separated by a 150 km (93 mi) wide channel of which only 31 are inhabited. Port Blair is the capital and largest city of the territory, located about 1,190 km (740 mi) from Chennai and 1,255 km (780 mi) from Kolkata in mainland India. The islands are sandwiched between the Bay of Bengal to the west and the Andaman Sea to the east with the northern-most point located 901 km (560 mi) from the mouth of Hooghly river. Indira Point at 6\u00b045\u201910\u2033N and 93\u00b049\u201936\u2033E at the southern tip of Great Nicobar is the southernmost point of India.\nThe territory shares maritime borders with Indonesia located about 165 km (103 mi) to the south, Myanmar located 280 km (170 mi) to the north-east and Thailand located 650 km (400 mi) to the south-east. The islands occupy a total land area of approximately 8,249 km2 (3,185 sq mi) with a population of 380,581 as per the 2011 census. The territory is divided into three districts: Nicobar, South Andaman, and North and Middle Andaman with the capitals at Car Nicobar, Port Blair and Mayabunder respectively.\nGenetic and cultural studies suggest that the indigenous Andamanese people may have been isolated from other populations during the Middle Paleolithic era, more than 30,000 years ago. Archeological evidence of civilization has been dated back to 2,200 years. In the 11th century CE, Cholas, one of the three Tamil kingdoms, used the islands as a naval base to launch an expeditions in South East Asia. The Danish were the first Europeans to arrive on the islands in 1755. The islands became part of the British Raj in 1868. During the Second World War, the islands were invaded by the Japanese Empire. After Indian Independence in 1947, the region became a province and later a union territory after the adoption of the Constitution of India in 1950.\nThe islands host the Andaman and Nicobar Command, the only geographical command operated jointly by the three major wings of the Indian Armed Forces: the Army, the Air Force and the Navy. While Hindi and English are the official languages, the major spoken languages include Bengali, Tamil and Telugu. Indigenous people speak any of the Andamanese or Nicobarese family of languages.

The place was called with a similar name by the Malay, who used to be involved in slave trade in the region. The place was also referred by various names such as Angademan by Ptolemy in the 2nd century CE and Angamanian by Marco Polo in 13th century CE. Nicobar, which was located in the sea route connecting South India to South East Asia, was known as Nakkavaram, meaning \"open/naked land\" borrowed from Tamil language which later became Nicobar. In the middle ages (500-1500 AD), Nicobar was known as Lankhabatus in Arabia, probably a mis-transcription of the name Nakkavaram. A 11th-century CE work Kathasaritsagar indicates the name as Narikel Dweep. Marco Polo termed the island as Necuverann, while the islands were known as Lo-Jan Kuo in China, a translation of Nakkavar with the same meaning.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nGenetic and cultural studies suggest that the indigenous Andamanese people may have been isolated from other populations during the Middle Paleolithic era, which ended 30,000 years ago. Archeological evidence obtained from middens have been dated the earliest civilisations back to 200-300 BCE. The islands have been mentioned by Ptolemy in the 2nd century CE.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe Nicobar islands existed on a major trade route connecting India to the South East Asia and had much contact with the outside world for centuries. But there are very few accounts of information as there was no written language with the indigenous people to document their history. The islands have been mentioned in the accounts of travellers like Faxian in the 6th century CE and I-T\u2019sing in 7th century CE.In the 11the century CE, Rajendra Chola I of the Chola dynasty of Tamilakam invaded parts of South East Asia using the Nicobar islands as an intermediate naval base. It was part of an established Chola trade route connecting India and South East Asia, with the practice continuing in the subsequent years during the reigns of Rajendra II and Kulothunga I. Chola inscriptions from Thanjavur, dated to 1050 CE, describe the islands as Ma-Nakkavaram meaning \"great open/naked land\" in Tamil. The islands are later mentioned later by Marco Polo in the 13th century CE and Friar Oderic in early 14th century CE.", "start_char_idx": 2534, "end_char_idx": 4907, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa33ebef-74c7-494a-a5a1-69c1ccbd662a": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa33ebef-74c7-494a-a5a1-69c1ccbd662a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Andaman_and_Nicobar_Islands.txt", "file_name": "Andaman_and_Nicobar_Islands.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25019, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f57485e9-1d05-4eab-9f96-0ff62d29ba1b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Andaman_and_Nicobar_Islands.txt", "file_name": "Andaman_and_Nicobar_Islands.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25019, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "c6cf48c36330607be4e47a30962315d59b629e40d4f2198ea0b351c476aca726", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b5686007-e6cb-4bc3-88fd-8984622975de", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Andaman_and_Nicobar_Islands.txt", "file_name": "Andaman_and_Nicobar_Islands.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25019, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "fc51674bdf240a18d34729338d7bf8bb39da62822f03d2bf7c25a57b043b4966", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1375b8fb-6f0b-41ac-aaf2-7b7c6fbd7519", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d9b984d745baa8bca99d78cb59e96e238bb800250a6fd242fbb5988385073868", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== European colonisation ===\nThe European colonisation on the islands began when settlers from the Danish East India Company arrived on the Nicobar Islands on 12 December 1755. On 1 January 1756, the Nicobar Islands were made into a Danish colony, first named Nye Danmark (New Denmark) and later Frederiks\u00f8erne (Frederick's Islands). The islands were managed from the Dutch colony of Tranqebar in the Indian mainland. However, various attempts to settle on the islands were unsuccessful due to repeated outbreaks of malaria, which led to the death of the colonists.\nBetween 1778 and 1783, William Bolts tried to establish an Austrian colony on the Nicobar islands, mistakenly assuming that the Danish had abandoned the claims to the islands, renaming them Theresa Islands. In 1789, the British colonised the Andaman islands to set up a naval base and establish a penal colony. In 1794, a first batch of 100 prisoners were sent to the island but the settlement was abandoned in 1796.In 1858, the British established a colony near Port Blair. Between 1864 and 1868, Italy tried to buy the island from the Danish. On 16 October 1868, the Danish sold the rights to the Nicobar islands to the British, which was made part of the British India in 1869. In 1872, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands were united under a single command and administered by a chief commissioner based out of Port Blair. The construction of the Cellular Jail started in 1896 and was completed in 1906. The jail was used to house political prisoners and independence activists away from the Indian mainland.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nDuring the Second World War, the islands were invaded by the Japanese as a part of their attack on the allies in 1942. Port Blair was captured by the Japanese on 23 March 1942 and established control over the island. The provisional control was passed on to the Azad Hind of Subhash Chandra Bose on 29 December 1943, based on the understanding with the Japanese with the islands renamed as Shaheed-Dweep (Martyr Island) and Swaraj-dweep (Self-rule Island). Bose appointed General A. D. Loganathan as the governor of the islands, who had limited power while the real control of the islands remained with the Japanese. In the years under Japanese occupation, there have been reports of widespread looting, arson, rape and extra judicial killings.Local people were often killed on trivial matters with the largest being the Homfreyganj massacre on 30 January 1944, where 44 local civilians were shot by the Japanese on suspicion of spying. Japanese Vice Admiral Teizo Hara and Major-General Tamenori Sato surrendered to Lieutenant Colonel Nathu Singh, the commanding officer of the Rajput Regiment on 15 August 1945, on board the Royal Navy warship HMS Sandbar and the territory was officially handed back over to the British to Brigadier J.

Foreign tourists are issued Restricted Area Permits (RAP) which gives access to specific areas with conditions. While domestic tourists do not require a permit to visit the accessible parts of the islands, the tribal reserves are forbidden and requires special permission for access. The islands have many beaches due to its long coastline and various water sports are practised including kayaking, scuba diving and parasailing.Major attractions include the Cellular Jail, Chatham Saw Mill, Forest Museum, Samudrika Naval Marine Museum, Anthropological Museum, Fisheries Aquarium, Science Center and Carbyn's cove in Port Blair; Bharatpur, Lakshmanpur and Sitapur beaches in Shaheed Dweep; Elephant and Radhanagar beaches in Swaraj Dweep; Hudi tikri, Red, Bird and Bat islands, Amkunj beach near Rangat; Dhaninallah mangroves and Karmatang beach near Mayabunder; limestone caves and mud volcanoes near Diglipur; Craggy island and Ross & Smith islands and various national parks and protected sanctuaries.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe islands are served by Veer Savarkar International Airport near Port Blair which has regular flights to major cities in India.

It has shared borders with  Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and the Bay of Bengal. It has the second-longest coastline in India at about 974 km (605 mi).  After existence as Andhra State and unified Andhra Pradesh, the state took its present form on 2 June 2014, when the new state of Telangana was formed through bifurcation.  Amaravati is the capital of the state, with the largest city being Visakhapatnam. Water sharing disputes and asset division with Telangana are not yet resolved. Telugu, one of the classical languages of India used by the majority of people, is the first official language.\nAs per the 8th century BCE Rigvedic text Aitareya Brahmana, the Andhras left North India off the banks of the Yamuna river and migrated to South India. In the third century BCE, Andhra was a vassal kingdom of Ashoka of the Mauryan Empire. After his death, it became powerful and extended its empire to the whole Maratha country and beyond under the rule of the Satavahana dynasty. After that, the major rulers included the Pallavas, Eastern Chalukyas, Kakatiyas, Vijayanagara Empire, Qutb Shahi dynasty, Nizam dynasty, East India Company, and British Raj.\nThe Eastern Ghats are a major dividing line separating coastal plains and peneplains. The coastal plains are part of Coastal Andhra. These are mostly delta regions formed by the Krishna, Godavari, and Penna rivers. Peneplains are part of Rayalaseema. 60% of the population is engaged in agriculture and related activities. Rice is the state's major food crop and staple food. The state contributes 10% of total fish production and over 70% of shrimp production in India. Industry sectors such as food products, non-metallic minerals, textiles, and pharmaceuticals are the top employment providers. The automotive sector accounts for 10% of India's auto exports. The state has about one-third of India's limestone reserves, large deposits of baryte and galaxy granite, and reserves of oil and natural gas. Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), known as Sriharikota Range (SHAR), at the barrier island of Sriharikota in Tirupati district, is the satellite launching station of India.\nSome of the unique products from the state are Banganapalle mangoes, Bandar laddu, Kondaplli toys, Tirupati laddu, and saris made in Dharmavaram and Machilipatnam. Kuchipudi is the official dance form. Many composers of Carnatic music, like Annamacharya, Kshetrayya, and Tyagaraja, were from this region. The Tirumala Venkateswara temple near Tirupati is the most visited Hindu religious place in the world.

The Satavahanas were mentioned by the names Andhra, Andhrara-jateeya, and Andhrabhrtya in the Puranic literature.

Archaeological evidence from places such as Bhattiprolu, Amaravati, Dharanikota, and Vaddamanu suggests that the Andhra region was part of the Mauryan empire. Amaravati might have been a regional centre under Mauryan rule. After the death of Emperor Ashoka, Mauryan rule weakened around 200 BCE and was replaced by several smaller kingdoms in the Andhra region. One of the earliest examples of the Brahmi script, the progenitor of several scripts, including Telugu, comes from Bhattiprolu, where the script was used on an urn containing the relics of Buddha.The Satavahana dynasty dominated the Deccan plateau from the 1st century BCE to the 3rd century CE. It had trade relations with the Roman Empire. The later Satavahanas made Dharanikota, near Amaravati, their capital. According to the Buddhists, Nagarjuna, the philosopher of Mahayana, lived in this region. The Andhra Ikshvakus, with their capital at Vijayapuri, succeeded the Satavahanas in the Krishna River valley in the latter half of the 2nd century. The Salankayanas were an ancient dynasty that ruled the Andhra region between Godavari and Krishna with their capital at Vengi (modern Pedavegi) from 300 to 440 CE. Telugu Cholas ruled present-day Rayalaseema from the fifth to the eleventh centuries from Cuddapa and Jammalamadugu. The Telugu inscription of Erikal Mutturaju Dhananjaya Varma, known as Erragudipadu sasanam, was engraved in 575 CE in the present Kadapa district. It is the earliest written record in Telugu.The Vishnukundinas were the first dynasty in the fifth and sixth centuries to hold sway over most of Andhra Pradesh, Kalinga, and parts of Telangana. The Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi, whose dynasty lasted for around five hundred years from the 7th century until 1130 CE, eventually merged with the Chola dynasty. They continued to rule under the protection of the Chola dynasty until 1189 CE.  At the request of King Rajaraja Narendra, Nannaya, considered the first Telugu poet, took up the translation of the Mahabharata into Telugu in 1025 CE.Kakatiyas ruled this region and Telangana for nearly two hundred years between the 12th and 14th centuries.

During their rule, the Pemmasani Nayaks controlled parts of Andhra Pradesh and had large mercenary armies that were the vanguard of the empire in the 16th century. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Sanskrit, while Carnatic music evolved into its current form.

This region passed under the rule of the Nizams under the Mughal Empire. Soon, Nizam established himself as the sovereign ruler. In 1611, an English trading post by the name of \"East India Company\" was established in Masulipatinam on India's east coast. In the early nineteenth century, Northern Circars was ceded to the British East India Company and became part of its Madras Presidency. Eventually, this region emerged as the Coastal Andhra region, the northern parts of which were later known as Uttarandhra. Later, the Nizam ceded five territories to the British, which eventually became the Rayalaseema region. The local chieftains, known as Poligars, revolted in 1800 against the company's rule, which was suppressed by the company.\nRaja Viziaram Raz (Vijayaram Raj) established a sovereign kingdom by claiming independence from the Kingdom of Jeypore in 1711. It formed alliances with the French and British East India Companies to conquer the neighbouring principalities of Bobbili, Kurupam, Paralakhemundi, and the kingdom of Jeypore. It fell out with the British and, as a result, was attacked and defeated in the battle of Padmanabham. It was annexed as a tributary estate like other principalities and remained so until their accession to the Indian Union in 1949.Following the Indian rebellion of 1857, the British crown ruled this region, until India became independent in 1947. The No Tax Campaign in Chirala and Perala in 1919, led by Duggirala Gopalakrishnayya, the Rampa Revolt led by Alluri Sitarama Raju in 1921, and the Salt Satyagraha in Dendulur in 1930 are some of the protests against British rule. Tanguturi Prakasam was arrested and jailed for more than three years for participating in the Quit India movement of 1942. He served as prime minister of the Madras presidency in 1946\u201347.Dowleswaram Barrage, built in 1850 by Arthur Cotton, brought unused lands in the Godavari river basin into cultivation and transformed the economy of the region. Charles Philip Brown did pioneering work in transforming Telugu to the print era and introduced Vemana poems to English readers. Kandukuri Veeresalingam is considered the father of the Telugu Renaissance Movement, as he encouraged the education of women and the remarriage of widows and fought against child marriage and the dowry system. Gurajada Apparao, a pioneering playwright who used spoken dialect, wrote the play Kanyasulkam in 1892. It is considered the greatest play in the Telugu language.\n\n\n==== Post-independence ====\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn an effort to gain an independent state based on linguistic identity and to protect the interests of the Telugu-speaking people of Madras State, Potti Sreeramulu fasted to death in 1952.

Tanguturi Prakasam became the first chief minister. On the basis of the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1956, the States Reorganisation Act created Andhra Pradesh by merging the neighbouring Telugu-speaking areas of the Hyderabad State with Hyderabad as the capital on 1 November 1956.The Indian National Congress (INC) ruled the state from 1956 to 1982. Neelam Sanjiva Reddy became the first chief minister. Among Congress chief ministers, P. V. Narasimha Rao is known for implementing land reforms and land ceiling acts and securing reservation for lower castes in politics. In 1983, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) won the state elections, and N. T. Rama Rao became the chief minister of the state for the first time after launching his party just nine months earlier. This broke the long-time single-party monopoly enjoyed by the INC. He transformed the sub-district administration by forming mandals in place of earlier taluks, removing hereditary village heads, and appointing non-hereditary village revenue assistants.  Nara Chandrababu Naidu, Rao's son-in-law, came to power in 1995 with the backing of a majority of the MLAs. He introduced e-governance by launching e-Seva centres in 2001 for paperless and speedy delivery of government services. He is credited with transforming Hyderabad into an IT hub by providing incentives for tech companies to set up centres. In 2004, Congress returned to power with a new chief ministerial face, YS Rajashekara Reddy, better known as YSR. The main emphasis during Reddy's tenure was on social welfare schemes such as free electricity for farmers, health insurance, tuition fee reimbursement for the poor, and the national rural employment guarantee scheme. He was elected chief minister again but was killed in a helicopter crash that occurred in September 2009. During its 58 years as a unified state, the state weathered separatist movements from Telangana (1969) and Andhra (1972) successfully. A new party called Telangana Rashtra Samithi, formed in April 2001 by Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), reignited the Telanganga movement. When the central government decided to initiate the process to form an independent Telangana in December 2009, Samaikyandhra movement to keep the state united took shape. The agitations continued for nearly 5 years, with the Telangana side led by Telangana Joint Action Committee harping on the marginalisation of food, culture, language, and unequal economic development and the Samaikyandhra movement focusing on the shared culture, language, customs, and historical unity of Telugu-speaking regions. The Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act bill was passed by the parliament of India for the formation of the Telangana state, comprising ten districts, despite opposition by the state legislature.  The new state of Telangana came into existence on 2 June 2014 after approval from the president of India, with the residual state continuing as Andhra Pradesh.In the final elections held in the unified state in 2014, the TDP got a mandate in its favour, defeating its nearest rival, the YSR Congress Party, a breakaway faction of the Congress founded by Y.

It has a coastline of around 974 kilometres (605 mi), which makes it the second-longest coastline in the nation.The Eastern Ghats are a major dividing line separating coastal plains and peneplains in the state's geography. The Eastern Coastal Plains comprise the area of coastal districts up to the Eastern Ghats as their border along the Bay of Bengal, with variable width. These are, for the most part, delta regions formed by the Krishna, Godavari, and Penna rivers. Most of the coastal plains are put to intensive agricultural use. The Eastern Ghats are discontinuous, and individual sections have local names. The ghats become more pronounced towards the south and extreme north of the coast. These consist of the Papikonda range, the Simhachal hill range, the Yarada hills, the Nallamala Hills, the Papi hills, the Seshachala hills, and the Horsley hills.

The protesters under the banner of Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi (APS) and the Joint Action Committee (JAC) of Amaravati received support from all the political parties barring the ruling YCP when they held their long marches across the state seeking support for their agitation.On 3 March 2022, the High Court ruled that the government could not abandon the development of Amaravati as the capital city after farmers parted with 33,000 acres of land against the agreement with Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA) to develop it as the capital city and \u20b915,000 crore was sunk in it over development expenditure. It asked the government to develop Amaravati within six months. When the government appealed to the Supreme Court, it got a stay on the judgement regarding developing the city within six months. The Supreme Court is set to hear it in April 2024, following its decision on 3 Jan 2024  about the government's request for expedited hearing.\n\n\n=== Interstate disputes ===", "start_char_idx": 26997, "end_char_idx": 30126, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d006810e-f64d-4418-a70f-cd55a360f163": {"__data__": {"id_": "d006810e-f64d-4418-a70f-cd55a360f163", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Andhra_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Andhra_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56355, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b8849499-6844-4d85-bb96-65cc099c53cd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Andhra_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Andhra_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56355, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "44e22817c3e84e8c655f64d492fd4162cc541f0da099a544b096a727679baf15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "28cac5b2-975a-4908-8dfa-4f398d6d316b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Andhra_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Andhra_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56355, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "99c3e59fc54555ab0efa7e7e2339e3c161351a79fca7f7a119936496c5ecf573", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1cb5418b-4583-4c0d-91d0-f2dce8d070ec", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "41428c3575586bfb6aab9a95f0c42bff4f7efdb8ffa72f653fb6c7ab1f2d7128", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Interstate disputes ===\n\n\n==== Assets division with Telangana ====\nThere are 91 institutions under schedule IX with assets of \u20b91.42 lakh crore, 142 institutions under schedule X with assets of \u20b924,018.53 crore, and another 12 institutions not mentioned in the act with assets of \u20b91,759 crore, which are to be split between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana following the bifurcation. An expert committee headed by Sheela Bhide gave a recommendation for bifurcation of 89 out of the 91 schedule IX institutions. Telangana selectively accepted the recommendations, while Andhra Pradesh asked for their acceptance in total. The division of the RTC headquarters and the Deccan Infrastructure and Landholdings Limited (DIL) with huge land parcels has become contentious. Despite several meetings of the trilateral dispute resolution committees, no progress was made. The Andhra Pradesh government filed a suit in the Supreme Court.\n\n\n==== Krishna river water sharing dispute ====\n\nAndhra Pradesh and Telangana continue to dispute the water share of the Krishna River. In 1969, the Bachawat tribunal for the allocation of water shares among the riparian states allocated 811 tmcft of water to Andhra Pradesh. The Andhra Pradesh government of that time split it in a 512:299 tmcft ratio between Andhra Pradesh (including the basin area of Rayalaseema) and Telangana, respectively. It was based on the utilisation facilities established at that time. Though the tribunal recommended the use of the Tungabhadra Dam (a part of the Krishna Basin) to provide water to the drought-prone Mahabubnagar area of Telangana, this was not implemented. The bifurcation act advised the formation of the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) and the Godavari River Management Board (GRMB) for resolving disputes between the new states. In 2015, the two states agreed to share water in the 66:34 (AP:Telangana) ratio as an interim arrangement in a meeting with the central water ministry, which is to be reviewed every year. This practice continued without further review. Telangana filed a suit in the Supreme Court for a 70% share. Following the assurance of the formation of a tribunal to resolve the issue, Telangana withdrew its suit. The centre formulated the terms of reference for KWDT-2 in Oct 2023.\n\n\n==== Godavari water sharing dispute ====\n\nAndhra Pradesh got 1172.78 tmcft of Godavari water. Telangana is utilising 433 tmcft for its completed projects, while Andhra Pradesh's share is 739 tmcft. The Andhra Pradesh government has opposed Telangana submitting a detailed project report for additional utilisation through new or upgraded projects such as Kaleswaram, Tupakulagudem, Sitarama, Mukteswaram, and Modikunta lift irrigation projects.\n\n\n==== Five villages near Bhadrachalam ====\nThe 1.50-metre increase in the height of the Polavaram coffer dam to 44 metres raised the suspicion that it led to flooding of Bhadrachalam and nearby villages in Telangana along the Godavari river in 2022. Three mandals that were originally part of Andhra State were transferred back to Andhra Pradesh, excluding Bhadrachalam town, to support the Polavaram project, as those areas are likely to be submerged. Telangana would like to take back five villages on the river banks for ease of movement of its government machinery to provide rehabilitation support to its other villages beyond them, to which the Andhra Pradesh government is objecting.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===", "start_char_idx": 30099, "end_char_idx": 33564, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1cb5418b-4583-4c0d-91d0-f2dce8d070ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "1cb5418b-4583-4c0d-91d0-f2dce8d070ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Andhra_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Andhra_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56355, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b8849499-6844-4d85-bb96-65cc099c53cd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Andhra_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Andhra_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56355, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "44e22817c3e84e8c655f64d492fd4162cc541f0da099a544b096a727679baf15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d006810e-f64d-4418-a70f-cd55a360f163", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Andhra_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Andhra_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56355, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "1f1b4c4bc4b60e01cccf0f8c4716eb6949c0c6e6cb11a91a3cc48f9713ae7d3c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "51ec470d-1d86-4fb2-8fd1-0434263d4e1f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e3ed14b9f9201da74bdd2ccdd22d1cc370b96db0c886476af6d7e7eaa9afa660", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n\n==== Roads ====\nThe state has a total major road network of 47,244.83 km (29,356.58 mi).

It was formed from the North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA) region, and India declared it as a state on 20 February 1987. Itanagar is its capital and largest town. It borders the Indian states of Assam and Nagaland to the south. It shares international borders with Bhutan in the west, Myanmar in the east, and a disputed 1,129 km border with China's Tibet Autonomous Region in the north at the McMahon Line. Arunachal Pradesh is claimed by China as part of the Tibet Autonomous Region; China occupied some regions of Arunachal Pradesh in 1962 but later withdrew its forces.As of the 2011 Census of India, Arunachal Pradesh has a population of 1,383,727 and an area of 83,743 square kilometres (32,333 sq mi). With only 17 inhabitants per square kilometre, it is the least densely populated state of India. It is an ethnically diverse state, with predominantly Monpa people in the west, Tani people in the centre, Mishmi and Tai people in the east, and Naga people in the southeast of the state. About 26 major tribes and 100 sub-tribes live in the state, including Nocte, Adi, Nyshi, Singpho, Galo, Tagin, Apatani. The Nyishi are the largest ethnic  group  in the region. The Mishmi tribe has three sub-tribes, namely Idu-Mishmi, Digaru-Mishmi and Miju-Mishmi.\n\n\n== Names and their etymology ==\nThe residents of eastern Arunachal Pradesh and some parts of Tibet in ancient Tibetan  text were called Lhobha people and the place as Lhoy\u00fc and western Arunachal Pradesh which includes the present Tawang district and Kameng District in Tibetan text were called Monyul (low land).People's Republic of China (PRC) and Republic of China (ROC) claim the land as South Tibet (Chinese: \u85cf\u5357 pinyin: Z\u00e0ngn\u00e1n).Arunachal Pradesh means Land of the Dawn-Lit Mountains, which is the sobriquet for the state in Sanskrit.\n\n\n== History ==", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1902, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b5027b1-4781-4444-b0b7-92cd43fc02f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b5027b1-4781-4444-b0b7-92cd43fc02f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 35539, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "03701648-bb0a-485d-9f85-62141486c3f6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 35539, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "4c8096733c6a14f1e6e3ab65a0d8c5ed91501034ed34b0ee2adb1bfaf6b01a46", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba02ac2a-8933-4977-a233-84c581226b7c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 35539, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "b36a7d02b449dc9e5beb47c50c3d9fdd9c541efaab410b12041bfb7c3955e1be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4281e8e7-6299-42fa-b4b2-184de2532004", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dede25cf9993be23404e1236b41fede97f85b81e556e32df9290a7985a924cab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient period ===\n\nVery little ancient history is known about the region apart from the Northwestern corner, and the areas bordering now Assam.\n\nNorthwestern parts of this area came under the control of the Monpa kingdom of Monyul under Tibet which flourished between 500 BCE and 600 CE.

It was divided into three sections, which eventually came to be called the Ballipara Frontier Tract, Lakhimpur Frontier Tract and Sadiya Frontier Tract.\n\n\n==== The McMahon line ====\n\nIn 1913\u20131914, representatives of the de facto independent state of Tibet and Britain met in India to define the borders of 'Outer Tibet' (with respect to China). British administrator Sir Henry McMahon drew the 550 miles (890 km) McMahon Line as the border between British India and Tibet, placing Tawang and other areas within British India. The Tibetan and British representatives devised the Simla Accord including the McMahon Line, but the Chinese representatives did not concur. The Simla Accord denies other benefits to China while it declines to assent to the Accord.The Chinese position was that Tibet was not independent from China and could not sign treaties, so the Accord was invalid, like the Anglo-Chinese (1906) and Anglo-Russian (1907) conventions. British records show that the condition for the Tibetan government to accept the new border was that China must accept the Simla Convention. As Britain was not able to get an acceptance from China, Tibetans considered the McMahon line invalid.In the time that China did not exercise power in Tibet, the line had no serious challenges. In 1935, a Deputy Secretary in the Foreign Department, Olaf Caroe, \"discovered\" that the McMahon Line was not drawn on official maps. The Survey of India published a map showing the McMahon Line as the official boundary in 1937. In 1938, two decades after the Simla Conference, the British finally published the Simla Accord as a bilateral accord and the Survey of India published a detailed map showing the McMahon Line as a border of India. In 1944, Britain established administrations in the area, from Dirang Dzong in the west to Walong in the east.\n\n\n=== Sino-Indian War ===\n\nFollowing the conclusion of British rule, India gained independence in 1947, while the People's Republic of China (PRC) was founded in 1949. Despite this, the new Chinese administration maintained its position that the McMahon Line was not valid. In November 1950, the PRC was poised to take over Tibet by force, and India supported Tibet. Journalist Sudha Ramachandran argued that China claimed Tawang on behalf of Tibetans, though Tibetans did not claim Tawang is in Tibet.What is now Arunachal Pradesh was established as the North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA) in 1954 and Sino-Indian relations were cordial until 1960. Resurgence of the border disagreement was a factor leading to the Sino-Indian War in 1962, during which China captured most of Arunachal Pradesh. During the 1962 Sino-Indian War, Tawang tract of Arunachal Pradesh was captured and temporarily controlled by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. However, China soon declared victory, withdrew back to the McMahon Line and returned Indian prisoners of war in 1963.The war resulted in the termination of barter trade with Tibet, although since 2007 the Indian government has shown signs of wanting to resume barter trade.", "start_char_idx": 5710, "end_char_idx": 8870, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58373023-ea6c-4779-a5f8-ec677ecf55bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "58373023-ea6c-4779-a5f8-ec677ecf55bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 35539, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "03701648-bb0a-485d-9f85-62141486c3f6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 35539, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "4c8096733c6a14f1e6e3ab65a0d8c5ed91501034ed34b0ee2adb1bfaf6b01a46", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f498a4c5-19cd-49c3-9498-3d787875e915", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 35539, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "798d459968b8a1161be01447327a5688f513baf3d1243ef751373c0915b3b903", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e6b737b3-8cf4-422a-a8c6-a09476da4c6f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ddd006744776d6386395530d03b81525746b599ffc720ce22d2e430c4414a617", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Renaming and statehood ===\nThe Indian government under the leadership of Indira Gandhi, The North-East Frontier Agency was renamed Arunachal Pradesh by Bibhabasu Das Shastri, Daya Krishna Goswami and O.

India rebutted these claims and told the Chinese government that Tawang is an integral part of India. India reiterated this to China when the two prime ministers met in Thailand in October 2009. A report that the Chinese Army had briefly invaded Arunachal Pradesh in 2016 was denied by India's Minister of State for Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju. In April 2017, China strongly objected to a visit to Tawang by the Dalai Lama, as it had to an earlier visit by the US ambassador to India. China had objected to the Dalai Lama's previous visits to the area.\n\n\n=== Insurgency ===\n\nArunachal Pradesh has faced threats from insurgent groups, notably the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN), who are believed to have base camps in the districts of Changlang and Tirap. These groups seek to decrease the influence of Indian government in the region and merge part of Arunachal Pradesh into Nagaland.\nThe Indian army is present along the Tibetan border to thwart any Chinese incursion.

The Indian National Congress Chief Minister Nabam Tuki replaced Jarbom Gamlin as the Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh on 1 November 2011 and continued until January 2016. After a political crisis in 2016, President's rule was imposed ending his tenure as the chief minister. In February 2016, Kalikho Pul became the Chief Minister when 14 disqualified MLAs were reinstated by the Supreme Court. On 13 July 2016, the Supreme Court quashed the Arunachal Pradesh Governor J.P. Rajkhowa's order to advance the Assembly session from 14 January 2016 to 16 December 2015, which resulted in President's rule in Arunachal Pradesh. As a result, Nabam Tuki was reinstated as the Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh on 13 July 2016. But hours before floor test, he resigned as the chief minister on 16 July 2016. He was succeeded by Pema Khandu as the INC Chief Minister who later joined PPA in September 2016 along with majority of MLAs. Pema Khandu further joined BJP in December 2016 along with majority of MLAs. Arunachal Pradesh becomes second northeast Indian state to achieve ODF status.During 2017, 2021, and 2023, China compiled a list of name alterations for multiple locations in Arunachal Pradesh, in both Chinese and Tibetan languages. China asserts these areas as belonging to \"Southern Tibet\" and being integral parts of China. The proposed changes encompassed 11 alterations, covering geographical landmarks like mountain summits and rivers, as well as residential zones. The Indian government has continued to reject Chinese claims of geographical ownership of parts of Arunachal Pradesh. National military forces on both sides have increased over the Indian-Chinese border.On 28 August 2023, China further provoked India when the PRC's Ministry of Natural Resources released its new 'standard map' in which Arunachal Pradesh was depicted as a part of PRC. Other internationally disputed lands and waters were also depicted as PRC territory on their new map.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nArunachal Pradesh is located between 26.28\u00b0 N and 29.30\u00b0 N latitude and 91.20\u00b0 E and 97.30\u00b0 E longitude and has an area of 83,743 km2 (32,333 sq mi).\nThe highest peak in the state is Kangto, at 7,060 metres (23,160 ft). Nyegi Kangsang, the main Gorichen peak, and the Eastern Gorichen peak are other tall Himalaya peaks. The state's mountain ranges, in the extreme East of India, are described as \"the place where the sun rises\" in historical Indian texts and named the Aruna Mountains, which inspired the name of the state. The villages of Dong (more accessible by car, and with a lookout favoured by tourists) and Vijaynagar (on the edge of Myanmar) receive the first sunlight in all of India.\n\nMajor rivers of Arunachal Pradesh include the Kameng, Subansiri, Siang (Brahmaputra), Dibang, Lohit and Noa Dihing rivers. Subsurface flows and summer snow melt contribute to the volume of water. Mountains until the Siang river are classified as the Eastern Himalayas. Those between the Siang and Noa Dihing are classified as the Mishmi Hills that may be part of the Hengduan Mountains. Mountains south of the Noa Dihing in Tirap and Longding districts are part of the Patkai Range.", "start_char_idx": 11430, "end_char_idx": 14693, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11cc54ad-aa0f-4817-ac12-9fa2f3c0bd79": {"__data__": {"id_": "11cc54ad-aa0f-4817-ac12-9fa2f3c0bd79", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 35539, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "03701648-bb0a-485d-9f85-62141486c3f6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 35539, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "4c8096733c6a14f1e6e3ab65a0d8c5ed91501034ed34b0ee2adb1bfaf6b01a46", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e6b737b3-8cf4-422a-a8c6-a09476da4c6f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 35539, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "e4928df7f2343be55fbbea882a097b83166357da205f0bc11f81afe3dc342e5b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "34d81aec-a98d-473b-a211-bae2304edfb2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "76f4d256d23d9ea5a5f560eae09bf70d674f9aa323d199005e6b0e4aac2d763d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Arunachal Pradesh varies with elevation. The low-altitude areas have a humid subtropical climate. High-altitude areas (3,500\u20135,500 m) have a subtropical highland climate and alpine climate. Arunachal Pradesh receives 2,000 to 5,000 millimetres (79 to 197 in) of rainfall annually, 70%\u201380% obtained between May and October.\n\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\nArunachal Pradesh has among the highest diversity of mammals and birds in India. There are around 750 species of birds and more than 200 species of mammals in the state.\n\n Arunachal's forests account for one-third of habitat area within the Himalayan biodiversity hot-spot. In 2013, 31,273 km2 (12,075 sq mi) of Arunachal's forests were identified as part of a vast area of continuous forests (65,730 km2 or 25,380 sq mi, including forests in Myanmar, China and Bhutan) known as Intact forest landscapes. There are three tiger reserves in the state: a reserve in Namdapha National Park, Mouling National Park and Pakke Tiger Reserve.\n\n\n=== Flora ===\nIn the year 2000, Arunachal Pradesh was covered with 63,093 km2 (24,360 sq mi) of tree cover (77% of its land area). It harbours over 5,000 plants, about 85 terrestrial mammals, over 500 birds and many butterflies, insects and reptiles. At the lowest elevations, essentially at Arunachal Pradesh's border with Assam, are Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests. Much of the state, including the Himalayan foothills and the Patkai hills, are home to Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests. Toward the northern border with Tibet, with increasing elevation, come a mixture of Eastern and Northeastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests followed by Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows and ultimately rock and ice on the highest peaks. It supports many medicinal plants and within Ziro valley of Lower Subansiri district 158 medicinal plants are being used by its inhabitants. The mountain slopes and hills are covered with alpine, temperate, and subtropical forests of dwarf rhododendron, oak, pine, maple and fir. The state has Mouling and Namdapha national parks.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe major animal species are tiger, leopard, snow leopard, Asian elephant, sambar deer, chital deer, barking deer, sloth bear, mithun (Bos frontalis), gaur, dhole, giant squirrel, marbled cat, leopard cat. A new subspecies of hoolock gibbon has been described from the state which has been named as the Mishmi Hills hoolock gibbon (H. h. mishmiensis). Three new giant flying squirrels were also described from the state during the last one and half-decade. These were, Mechuka giant flying squirrel, Mishmi Hills giant flying squirrel, and Mebo giant flying squirrel.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\nArunachal Pradesh comprises three divisions, namely, Central, East and West, each headed by a divisional commissioner and twenty-five districts, each administered by a deputy commissioner.

Agriculture primarily drives the economy. Jhum, the local term used for shifting cultivation is being widely practised among the tribal groups, though owing to the gradual growth of other sources of income in the recent years, it is not being practised as prominently as it was earlier. Arunachal Pradesh has close to 61,000 km2 of forests, and forest products are the next most significant sector of the economy. Among the crops grown here are rice, maize, millet, wheat, pulses, sugarcane, ginger, and oilseeds. Arunachal is also ideal for horticulture and fruit orchards. Its major industries are rice mills, fruit preservation and processing units, and handloom handicrafts. Sawmills and plywood trades are prohibited under law. There are many saw mills in the state.A significant portion of India's unexplored hydroelectric capacity is attributed to Arunachal Pradesh. In 2008, the Arunachal Pradesh government entered into several memoranda of understanding with multiple companies, outlining around 42 hydroelectric projects intended to generate over 27,000 MW of electricity.

In between there are transition zones, such as the Aka/Hruso/Miji/Sherdukpen area, between the Tibetan Buddhist tribes and the animist Tani hill tribes. In addition, there are isolated peoples scattered throughout the state, such as the Sulung.\nWithin each of these cultural spheres, one finds populations of related tribes speaking related languages and sharing similar traditions. In the Tibetic area, one finds large numbers of Monpa tribespeople, with several subtribes speaking closely related but mutually incomprehensible languages, and also large numbers of Tibetan refugees. Within the Tani area, major tribes include the Nyishi. Apatani also live among the Nyishi, but are distinct. In the north one find the Tagin People. In the centre, one finds predominantly Galo people, with the major sub-groups of Karka, Lodu, Bogum, Lare and Pugo among others, extending to the Ramo and Pailibo areas (which are close in many ways to Galo). In the east, one finds the Adi with many subtribes including Padam, Pasi, Minyong and Bokar, among others. Milang, while also falling within the general Adi sphere, are in many ways quite distinct. Moving east, the Idu, Miju and Digaru make up the Mishmi cultural-linguistic area.\nMoving southeast, the Tai Khamti are linguistically distinct from their neighbours and culturally distinct from the majority of other Arunachalese tribes. They follow the Theravada sect of Buddhism. They also exhibit considerable convergence with the Singpho and Tangsa Naga tribes of the same area, all of which are also found in Burma. They are one of the most recent people group migrated to Arunachal region from Burma. The Nocte Naga and Wancho Naga are another two major ethnic tribes. Both the tribes exhibit very much cultural similarities. Finally, the Deori tribe is also a major community in the state, with their own distinctive identity. They are the descendants of the priestly class of Chutia people who were allowed to continue their livelihood after the defeat of the Chutias. Deoris are one of the only Arunachal tribes in the historical records \u2013 which shows they are among the first ethnic groups to inhabit the Himalayas of the districts of Dibang Valley and Lohit, before the arrival of many other tribes in the region between 1600 and 1900.\n\nLiteracy has risen in official figures to 66.95% in 2011 from 54.74% in 2001.

A relatively large percentage of Arunachal's population are nature worshippers (indigenous religions), and follow their own distinct traditional institutions like the Nyedar Namlo by the Nyishi, the Rangfrah by the Tangsa & Nocte, Medar Nelo by the Apatani, the Kargu Gamgi by the Galo and Donyi-Polo Dere by the Adi under the umbrella of the indigenous religion the Donyi-Polo. A small number of Arunachali people have traditionally identified as Hindus, although the number may grow as animist traditions are absorbed into Hinduism. Tibetan Buddhism predominates in the districts of Tawang, West Kameng, and isolated regions adjacent to Tibet. Theravada Buddhism is practised by groups living near the Myanmar border. Around 30% of the population are Christians.Buddhism arrived in Arunachal Pradesh in 8th century CE from Tibet.According to the 2011 Indian Census, the religions of Arunachal Pradesh break down as follows:\nChristians: 418,732 (30.26%)\nHindus: 401,876 (29.04%)\nOthers: 362,553 (26.20%)\nBuddhists: 162,815 (11.77%)\nMuslims: 27,045 (1.95%)\nSikhs: 3,287 (0.24%)\nJains: 771 (0.06%)In 1971, the percentage of Christians in the state was 0.79%. This increased to 10.3% by 1991 and by 2011 it had crossed 30%.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThe speakers of major languages of the state according to the 2011 census are Nyishi (20.74%), Adi (17.35%, includes Adi and Gallong), Nepali (6.89%), Tagin (4.54%), Bhotia (4.51%), Wancho (4.23%), Assamese (3.9%), Bangla (3.65%), Hindi (3.45%), Chakma (3.40%), Apatani (3.21%), Mishmi (3.04%), Tangsa (2.64%), Nocte (2.19%), Bhojpuri (2.04%) and Sadri (1.03%).\nThe vast majority of Arunachal Pradesh speaks Tani languages of the Tibeto Burman language family. Tani people are indigenous to central Arunachal Pradesh, including (moving from west to east) the Nyishi, the Apatani, the Tagin, the Galo, the Bokar, the Adi, the Padam, the Pasi, and the Minyong. The Tani languages are noticeably characterised by an overall relative uniformity, suggesting relatively recent origin and dispersal within their present-day area of concentration. Most of the Tani languages are mutually intelligible with at least one other Tani language, meaning that the area constitutes a dialect chain, as was once found in much of Europe; only Apatani and Milang stand out as relatively unusual in the Tani context. Tani languages are among the better-studied languages of the region.To the east of the Tani area lie three virtually undescribed and highly endangered languages of the \"Mishmi\" group of Tibeto-Burman: Idu, Digaru and Mishmi people.

A number of speakers of these languages are also found in Tibet. The relationships of these languages, both amongst one another and to other area languages, are as yet uncertain. Further south, one finds the Singpho (Kachin) language, which is primarily spoken by large populations in Myanmar's Kachin State, and the Nocte and Wancho languages, which show affiliations to certain Naga languages spoken to the south in modern-day Nagaland.\nTo the west and north of the Tani area are found at least one and possibly as many as four Bodic languages, including Dakpa and Tshangla language; within modern-day India, these languages go by the cognate but, in usage, distinct designations Monpa and Memba. Most speakers of these languages or closely related Bodic languages are found in neighbouring Bhutan and Tibet, and Monpa and Memba populations remain closely adjacent to these border regions.Between the Bodic and Tani areas lie many almost completely undescribed and unclassified languages, which, speculatively considered Tibeto-Burman, exhibit many unique structural and lexical properties that probably reflect both a long history in the region and a complex history of language contact with neighbouring populations. Among them are Sherdukpen, Bugun, Hruso, Koro, Miji, Bangru and Puroik/Sulung. The high linguistic significance these languages is belied by the extreme paucity of documentation and description of them, even in view of their highly endangered status. Puroik, in particular, is perhaps one of the most culturally and linguistically unique and significant populations in all of Asia from proto-historical and anthropological-linguistic perspectives, and yet virtually no information of any real reliability regarding their culture or language can be found in print.Finally, other than the Bodic and Tani groups, there are also certain migratory languages that are largely spoken by migratory and central government employees serving in the state in different departments and institutions in modern-day Arunachal Pradesh. They are classified as Non-Tribal as per the provisions of the Constitution of India.\nOutside of Tibeto-Burman, one finds in Arunachal Pradesh a single representative of the Tai family, spoken by Tai Khamti, which is closely affiliated to the Shan language of Myanmar's Shan State. Seemingly, Khampti is a recent arrival in Arunachal Pradesh whose presence dates to 18th and/or early 19th-century migrations from northern Myanmar.In addition to English, various Indo-Aryan languages Assamese, Bengali, Nepali and especially Hindi are making strong inroads into Arunachal Pradesh. Primarily as a result of the primary education system\u2014in which classes are generally taught by Hindi-speaking migrant teachers from Bihar and other Hindi-speaking parts of northern India, a large and growing section of the population now speaks a semi-creolised variety of Hindi as a mother tongue. Hindi acts as a lingua franca for most of the people in the state. Despite, or perhaps because of, the linguistic diversity of the region, English is the only official language recognised in the state.\n\n\n== Transport ==", "start_char_idx": 25161, "end_char_idx": 28531, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f660bc86-f142-4d71-8c35-bc6a89bfea0d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f660bc86-f142-4d71-8c35-bc6a89bfea0d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 35539, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "03701648-bb0a-485d-9f85-62141486c3f6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 35539, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "4c8096733c6a14f1e6e3ab65a0d8c5ed91501034ed34b0ee2adb1bfaf6b01a46", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "87b5906e-d078-4b8a-805b-0d949b641a7a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Arunachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 35539, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "740ae865f9b9a499d72312741399c053afca0517a7cbe1ac8056462be37325d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2e77b0e2-02a8-49fb-a6ba-5a58ac610560", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "60b2196553c9badeebd1bf632bfa12c45ae5ca1132787350ba4c5b22871c7f0a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Hindi acts as a lingua franca for most of the people in the state.

Alliance Air operates the only scheduled flights to the state flying from Kolkata via Guwahati to Pasighat Airport. This route commenced in May 2018 under the Government's Regional Connectivity Scheme UDAN following the completion of a passenger terminal at Pasighat Airport in 2017. State-owned Daporijo Airport, Ziro Airport, Along Airport, and Tezu Airport are small and not in operation, but the government has proposed to develop them. Before the state was connected by roads, these airstrips were used to distribute food.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nThe main highway of Arunachal Pradesh is the Trans-Arunachal Highway, National Highway 13 (1,293 km (803 mi); formerly NH-229 and NH-52). It originates in Tawang and spans most of the width of Arunachal Pradesh, then crosses south into Assam and ends at Wakro. The project was announced by then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2008 for completion by 2015\u201316, but only became operational in 2018.\nNH-15 through Assam follows the southern border of Arunachal Pradesh. Access to central Arunachal Pradesh has been facilitated by the Bogibeel Bridge, an earthquake-resistant rail and road bridge over the Brahmaputra River in Assam, opened for public use on 25 December 2018 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A spur highway numbered NH-415 services Itanagar.\nState-owned Arunachal Pradesh State Transport Services (APSTS) runs daily bus service from Itanagar to most district headquarters including Tezpur, Guwahati in Assam, Shillong in Meghalaya, and Dimapur in Nagaland.As of 2007, every village is connected by road, thanks to funding provided by the central government. Every small town has its own bus station with daily bus service. Connections to Assam have increased commerce.\nIn 2014, two additional east\u2013west highways were proposed: an Industrial Corridor Highway in the lower foothills, and a Frontier Highway along the McMahon Line. The proposed alignment of the Frontier Highway has been published.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nArunachal Pradesh got its first railway line in late 2013 with the opening of the new link line from Harmuti on the main Rangpara North\u2013Murkongselak railway line to Naharlagun in Arunachal Pradesh. The construction of the 33-kilometre 5 ft 6 in (1,676 mm) broad-gauge railway line was completed in 2012, and the link became operational after the gauge conversion of the main line from Assam. The state capital Itanagar was added to the Indian railway map on 12 April 2014 via the newly built 20-kilometre Harmuti-Naharlagun railway line, when a train from Dekargaon in Assam reached Naharlagun railway station, 10 kilometres from the centre of Itanagar, a total distance of 181 kilometres.On 20 February 2015 the first through train was run from New Delhi to Naharlagun, flagged off from the capital by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi.

It caters to the students from  Tirap , Changlang and Longding districts.\nThere are also trust institutes, like Pali Vidyapith, run by Buddhists. They teach Pali and Khamti scripts in addition to typical education subjects. Khamti is the only tribe in Arunachal Pradesh that has its own script. Libraries of scriptures are in a number of places in Lohit district, the largest one being in Chowkham.\nThe state has two polytechnic institutes: Rajiv Gandhi Government Polytechnic in Itanagar established in 2002 and Tomi Polytechnic College in Basar established in 2006. There are two law colleges, namely, the private-owned Arunachal Law Academy at Itanagar and the government-owned Jarbom Gamlin Government Law College at Jote, Itanagar.

It covers an area of more than 44 million square kilometers, about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8% of Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Its 4.7 billion people constitute roughly 60% of the world's population.Asia shares the landmass of Eurasia with Europe, and of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa. In general terms, it is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East\u2013West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. A commonly accepted division places Asia to the east of the Suez Canal separating it from Africa; and to the east of the Turkish Straits, the Ural Mountains and Ural River, and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black seas, separating it from Europe.China and India traded places as the largest economies in the world from 1 to 1800 CE. China was a major economic power for much of recorded history, with the highest GDP per capita until 1500. The Silk Road became the main east\u2013west trading route in the Asian hinterlands while the Straits of Malacca stood as a major sea route. Asia has exhibited economic dynamism as well as robust population growth during the 20th century, but overall population growth has since fallen. Asia was the birthplace of most of the world's mainstream religions including Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Jainism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, as well as many other religions.\nAsia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties, and government systems. It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot deserts in West Asia, temperate areas in the east and the  continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in Siberia.\n\n\n== Definition and boundaries ==\n\n\n=== Asia\u2013Africa boundary ===\nThe boundary between Asia and Africa is the Suez Canal, the Gulf of Suez, the Red Sea, and the Bab-el-Mandeb.

This makes Egypt a transcontinental country, with the Sinai peninsula in Asia and the remainder of the country in Africa.\n\n\n=== Asia\u2013Europe boundary ===\nThe threefold division of the Old World into Africa, Asia, and Europe has been in use since the 6th century BCE, due to Greek geographers such as Anaximander and Hecataeus. Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern Rioni river) in Georgia of Caucasus (from its mouth by Poti on the Black Sea coast, through the Surami Pass and along the Kura River to the Caspian Sea), a convention still followed by Herodotus in the 5th century BCE. During the Hellenistic period, this convention was revised, and the boundary between Europe and Asia was now considered to be the Tanais (the modern Don River). This is the convention used by Roman era authors such as Posidonius, Strabo and Ptolemy.The border between Asia and Europe was historically defined by European academics. The Don River became unsatisfactory to northern Europeans when Peter the Great, king of the Tsardom of Russia, defeating rival claims of Sweden and the Ottoman Empire to the eastern lands, and armed resistance by the tribes of Siberia, synthesized a new Russian Empire extending to the Ural Mountains and beyond, founded in 1721.In Sweden, five years after Peter's death, in 1730 Philip Johan von Strahlenberg published a new atlas proposing the Ural Mountains as the border of Asia. Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg. The latter had suggested the Emba River as the lower boundary. Over the next century various proposals were made until the Ural River prevailed in the mid-19th century. The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects. The border between the Black Sea and the Caspian is usually placed along the crest of the Caucasus Mountains, although it is sometimes placed further north.\n\n\n=== Asia\u2013Oceania boundary ===\nThe border between Asia and the region of Oceania is usually placed somewhere in the Indonesia Archipelago. The Maluku Islands are often considered to lie on the border of southeast Asia, with Indonesian New Guinea, to the east of the islands, being wholly part of Oceania. The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception. The chief factor in determining which islands of the Indonesian Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there (not all European). Lewis and Wigen assert, \"The narrowing of 'Southeast Asia' to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process.\"", "start_char_idx": 2434, "end_char_idx": 5314, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8863ad7-e56f-426f-8fe7-7ce56a387d07": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8863ad7-e56f-426f-8fe7-7ce56a387d07", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Assam.txt", "file_name": "Assam.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 43160, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "311c4e3d-0332-477d-afe4-f0183750ff7f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Assam.txt", "file_name": "Assam.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 43160, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "cea1db871e9da45fbd4671c4178cfeb73ada1f46e7cefb3fb23e584bce97f458", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1ad52f9a-28f5-46f6-9cb2-d4adfe01f55a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Assam.txt", "file_name": "Assam.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 43160, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "7a9397f0a35f6dd97b94957e791efaf1d5d1d2029db6342156e1d37be3a96e66", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ee0f8468-a76b-481d-a925-dde341d92aca", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8646b1baa244654a76938d6ce6590969852ca02a0abe5a7f9d2c15507d043c1b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Asia\u2013North America boundary ===\nThe Bering Strait and Bering Sea separate the landmasses of Asia and North America, as well as forming the international boundary between Russia and the United States. This national and continental boundary separates the Diomede Islands in the Bering Strait, with Big Diomede in Russia and Little Diomede in the United States. The Aleutian Islands are an island chain extending westward from the Alaskan Peninsula toward Russia's Komandorski Islands and Kamchatka Peninsula. Most of them are always associated with North America, except for the westernmost Near Islands group, which is on Asia's continental shelf beyond the North Aleutians Basin and on rare occasions could be associated with Asia, which could then allow the U.S. state of Alaska as well as the United States itself to be considered a transcontinental state. The Aleutian Islands are sometimes associated with Oceania, owing to their status as remote Pacific islands, and their proximity to the Pacific Plate. This is extremely rare however, due to their non-tropical biogeography, as well as their inhabitants, who have historically been related to Indigenous Americans.St. Lawrence Island in the northern Bering Sea belongs to Alaska and may be associated with either continent but is almost always considered part of North America, as with the Rat Islands in the Aleutian chain.

Asia does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents.From the time of Herodotus a minority of geographers have rejected the three-continent system (Europe, Africa, Asia) on the grounds that there is no substantial physical separation between them. For example, Sir Barry Cunliffe, the emeritus professor of European archeology at Oxford, argues that Europe has been geographically and culturally merely \"the western excrescence of the continent of Asia\".Geographically, Asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of Eurasia with Europe being a northwestern peninsula of the landmass. Asia, Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass\u2014Afro-Eurasia (except for the Suez Canal)\u2014and share a common continental shelf.

The term appears in Hittite records recounting how a confederation of Assuwan states including Troy unsuccessfully rebelled against the Hittite king Tudhaliya I around 1400 BCE. Roughly contemporary Linear B documents contain the term asiwia (Mycenaean Greek: \ud800\udc00\ud800\udc2f\ud800\udc39\ud800\udc0a, romanized: a-si-wi-ja), seemingly in reference to captives from the same area.\nHerodotus used the term \u1f08\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 in reference to Anatolia and the territory of the Persian Empire, in contrast to Greece and Egypt. He reports that Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of Prometheus, but that Lydians say it was named after Asies, son of Cotys, who passed the name on to a tribe at Sardis. In Greek mythology, \"Asia\" (\u1f08\u03c3\u03af\u03b1) or \"Asie\" (\u1f08\u03c3\u03af\u03b7) was the name of a \"Nymph or Titan goddess of Lydia\". The Iliad (attributed by the ancient Greeks to Homer) mentions two Phrygians in the Trojan War named Asios (an adjective meaning \"Asian\"); and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as \u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2.The term was later adopted by the Romans, who used it in reference to the province of Asia, located in western Anatolia. One of the first writers to use Asia as a name of the whole continent was Pliny.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions: East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and West Asia. The coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys. The civilizations in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley and the Yellow River shared many similarities. These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel. Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area. Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands.\nThe central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the steppes. The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the Indo-Europeans, who spread their languages into the Middle East, South Asia, and the borders of China, where the Tocharians resided. The northernmost part of Asia, including much of Siberia, was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and tundra. These areas remained very sparsely populated.\nThe center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts. The Caucasus and Himalaya mountains and the Karakum and Gobi deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty. While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the nomads who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.", "start_char_idx": 8047, "end_char_idx": 11284, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c23c51ed-8f51-4db2-8351-44ad796c9fde": {"__data__": {"id_": "c23c51ed-8f51-4db2-8351-44ad796c9fde", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Assam.txt", "file_name": "Assam.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 43160, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "311c4e3d-0332-477d-afe4-f0183750ff7f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Assam.txt", "file_name": "Assam.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 43160, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "cea1db871e9da45fbd4671c4178cfeb73ada1f46e7cefb3fb23e584bce97f458", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ee0f8468-a76b-481d-a925-dde341d92aca", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Assam.txt", "file_name": "Assam.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 43160, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "7d8dd6ba50136cec5411798c958b064035e03cab87d6f78a7dae937b0c851d46", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5c42a969-1578-49c4-b928-86ac225aec9d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1622648342be594ffd311b6b1a13ae1f1f7c8c29367fa235653f2dde2b96bc47", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the nomads who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.\nThe Islamic Caliphate's defeats of the Byzantine and Persian empires led to West Asia and southern parts of Central Asia and western parts of South Asia under its control during its conquests of the 7th century. The Mongol Empire conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Before the Mongol invasion, Song dynasty reportedly had approximately 120 million citizens; the 1300 census which followed the invasion reported roughly 60 million people.The Black Death, one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central Asia, where it then travelled along the Silk Road.The Russian Empire began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of Siberia and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. The Ottoman Empire controlled Anatolia, most of the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the mid 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the Manchu conquered China and established the Qing dynasty. The Islamic Mughal Empire and the Hindu Maratha Empire controlled much of India in the 16th and 18th centuries respectively.Western European colonisation of Asia coincided with the Industrial Revolution in the West and the dethroning of India and China as the world's foremost economies. The British Empire became dominant in South Asia, with large parts of the region first being conquered by British traders before falling under direct British rule; extreme poverty doubled to over 50% during this era. The Middle East was contested and partitioned by the British and French, while Southeast Asia was carved up between the British, Dutch and French. Various Western powers dominated China in what later became known as the \"century of humiliation\", with the British-supported opium trade and later Opium Wars resulting in China being forced into an unprecedented situation of importing more than it exported. Foreign domination of China was furthered by the Empire of Japan, which controlled most of East Asia and much of Southeast Asia, New Guinea and the Pacific islands during this era; Japan's domination was enabled by its rapid rise that had taken place during the Meiji era of the late 19th century, in which it applied industrial knowledge learned from the West and thus overtook the rest of Asia.With the end of World War II in 1945 and the wartime ruination of Europe and imperial Japan, many countries in Asia were able to rapidly free themselves of colonial rule. The independence of India came along with the carving out of a separate nation for the majority of Indian Muslims, which today has become the countries Pakistan and Bangladesh.Some Arab countries took economic advantage of massive oil deposits that were discovered in their territory, becoming globally influential. East Asian nations (along with Singapore in Southeast Asia) became economically prosperous with high-growth \"tiger economies\", with China regaining its place among the top two economies of the world by the 21st century.

It covers 9% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the longest coastline, at 62,800 kilometres (39,022 mi). Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of Eurasia. It is located to the east of the Suez Canal and the Ural Mountains, and south of the Caucasus Mountains (or the Kuma\u2013Manych Depression) and the Caspian and Black Seas. It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. Asia is subdivided into 49 countries, five of them (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey) are transcontinental countries lying partly in Europe. Geographically, Russia is partly in Asia, but is considered a European nation, both culturally and politically.\nThe Gobi Desert is in Mongolia and the Arabian Desert stretches across much of the Middle East. The Yangtze River in China is the longest river in the continent. The Himalayas between Nepal and China is the tallest mountain range in the world. Tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern Asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Main regions ===\nThere are various approaches to the regional division of Asia. The following subdivision into regions is used, among others, by the UN statistics agency UNSD. This division of Asia into regions by the United Nations is done solely for statistical reasons and does not imply any assumption about political or other affiliations of countries and territories.\nNorth Asia (Siberia)\nCentral Asia\nWest Asia (The Middle East or Near East and the Caucasus)\nSouth Asia\nEast Asia (Far East)\nSoutheast Asia (East Indies and Indochina)\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nAsia has extremely diverse climate features. Climates range from arctic and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia. It is moist across southeast sections, and dry across much of the interior. Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia. The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer. Southwestern sections of the continent are hot. Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere, and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America. The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan.", "start_char_idx": 14363, "end_char_idx": 17247, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "657f2abe-f3b1-4fed-a24a-ae30f13927ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "657f2abe-f3b1-4fed-a24a-ae30f13927ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Assam.txt", "file_name": "Assam.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 43160, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "311c4e3d-0332-477d-afe4-f0183750ff7f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Assam.txt", "file_name": "Assam.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 43160, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "cea1db871e9da45fbd4671c4178cfeb73ada1f46e7cefb3fb23e584bce97f458", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5c42a969-1578-49c4-b928-86ac225aec9d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Assam.txt", "file_name": "Assam.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 43160, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "ad7a1700244df328d32cffce818922358abc35737c79d0d44923233ff39fbecc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "74af407a-8c75-40bf-9717-199780569ebb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ba6a3e30e2cd1b0cb371e1b85cd128c3530bbf8bb201fddcc3471738538ebf23", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "==== Climate change ====\n\nClimate change is having major impacts on many countries in the continent.\nA survey carried out in 2010 by global risk analysis farm Maplecroft identified 16 countries that are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Each nation's vulnerability was calculated using 42 socio, economic and environmental indicators, which identified the likely climate change impacts during the next 30 years. The Asian countries of Bangladesh, India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Pakistan, China and Sri Lanka were among the 16 countries facing extreme risk from climate change. Some shifts are already occurring. For example, in tropical parts of India with a semi-arid climate, the temperature increased by 0.4 \u00b0C between 1901 and 2003.\nA 2013 study by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) aimed to find science-based, pro-poor approaches and techniques that would enable Asia's agricultural systems to cope with climate change, while benefiting poor and vulnerable farmers. The study's recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weather-based agro-advisory services, to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover, replenish groundwater and use renewable energy.The ten countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \u2013 Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam \u2013 are among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change in the world, however, ASEAN's climate mitigation efforts are not commensurate with the climate threats and risks it faces.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAsia has the largest continental economy in the world by both GDP nominal and PPP values, and is the fastest growing economic region. As of 2023, China is by far the largest economy on the continent, making up nearly half of the continent's economy by GDP nominal. It is followed by Japan, India, South Korea, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which are all ranked amongst the top 20 largest economies both by nominal and PPP values. Based on Global Office Locations 2011, Asia dominated the office locations with 4 of the top 5 being in Asia: Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul. Around 68 percent of international firms have an office in Hong Kong.In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the economy of China had an average annual growth rate of more than 8%. According to economic historian Angus Maddison, India had the world's largest economy during 1000 BCE and 1 CE. India was the largest economy in the world for most of the two millennia from the 1st until 19th century, contributing 25% of the world's industrial output. China was the largest and most advanced economy on earth for much of recorded history and shared the mantle with India. For several decades in the late twentieth century Japan was the largest economy in Asia and second-largest of any single nation in the world, after surpassing the Soviet Union (measured in net material product) in 1990 and Germany in 1968. (NB: A number of supernational economies are larger, such as the European Union (EU), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or APEC). This ended in 2010 when China overtook Japan to become the world's second largest economy. It is forecasted that India will overtake Japan in terms of nominal GDP by 2027.In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Japan's GDP by currency exchange rates was almost as large as that of the rest of Asia combined.", "start_char_idx": 17250, "end_char_idx": 20874, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74af407a-8c75-40bf-9717-199780569ebb": {"__data__": {"id_": "74af407a-8c75-40bf-9717-199780569ebb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Assam.txt", "file_name": "Assam.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 43160, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "311c4e3d-0332-477d-afe4-f0183750ff7f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Assam.txt", "file_name": "Assam.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 43160, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "cea1db871e9da45fbd4671c4178cfeb73ada1f46e7cefb3fb23e584bce97f458", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "657f2abe-f3b1-4fed-a24a-ae30f13927ea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Assam.txt", "file_name": "Assam.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 43160, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "286cf423384825fca14003c8ead73e3d7ebefc54151d774cac44aa5ff6808e65", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5091267e-7d13-40bc-976a-a77ce12e0b3c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c9abc23a54d1f1560c259a7f335351944b7075edfd160d3a8189e812bbb2d670", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "This ended in 2010 when China overtook Japan to become the world's second largest economy.

In 1995, Japan's economy nearly equaled that of the US as the largest economy in the world for a day, after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79 yen/US$. Economic growth in Asia since World War II to the 1990s had been concentrated in Japan as well as the four regions of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore located in the Pacific Rim, known as the Asian tigers, which are now all considered developed economies, having amongst the highest GDP per capita in Asia.\nAsia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin, and it is rich in natural resources, such as petroleum, forests, fish, water, rice, copper and silver. Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, India, the Philippines, and Singapore. Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of multinational corporations, but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads. Many companies from Europe, North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia's developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure.According to Citigroup in 2011, 9 of 11 Global Growth Generators countries came from Asia driven by population and income growth. They are Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Mongolia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam. Asia has three main financial centers: Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore. Call centers and business process outsourcing (BPOs) are becoming major employers in India and the Philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly skilled, English-speaking workers. The increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of India and the China as financial centers. Due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry, India has become a major hub for outsourcing.Trade between Asian countries and countries on other continents is largely carried out on the sea routes that are important for Asia. Individual main routes have emerged from this. The main route leads from the Chinese coast south via Hanoi to Jakarta, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur through the Strait of Malacca via the Sri Lankan Colombo to the southern tip of India via Mal\u00e9 to East Africa Mombasa, from there to Djibouti, then through the Red Sea over the Suez Canal into Mediterranean, there via Haifa, Istanbul and Athens to the upper Adriatic to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its rail connections to Central and Eastern Europe or further to Barcelona and around Spain and France to the European northern ports. A far smaller part of the goods traffic runs via South Africa to Europe. A particularly significant part of the Asian goods traffic is carried out across the Pacific towards Los Angeles and Long Beach. In contrast to the sea routes, the Silk Road via the land route to Europe is on the one hand still under construction and on the other hand is much smaller in terms of scope. Intra-Asian trade, including sea trade, is growing rapidly.In 2010, Asia had 3.3 million millionaires (people with net worth over US$1 million excluding their homes), slightly below North America with 3.4 million millionaires.

In 2011, Asia topped Europe in number of millionaires.\nCitigroup in The Wealth Report 2012 stated that Asian centa-millionaire overtook North America's wealth for the first time as the world's \"economic center of gravity\" continued moving east. At the end of 2011, there were 18,000 Asian people mainly in Southeast Asia, China and Japan who have at least $100 million in disposable assets, while North America with 17,000 people and Western Europe with 14,000 people.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nWith growing Regional Tourism with domination of Chinese visitors, MasterCard has released Global Destination Cities Index 2013 with 10 of 20 are dominated by Asia and Pacific Region Cities and also for the first time a city of a country from Asia (Bangkok) set in the top-ranked with 15.98 million international visitors.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nEast Asia had by far the strongest overall Human Development Index (HDI) improvement of any region in the world, nearly doubling average HDI attainment over the past 40 years, according to the report's analysis of health, education and income data. China, the second highest achiever in the world in terms of HDI improvement since\n1970, is the only country on the \"Top 10 Movers\" list due to income rather than health or education achievements. Its per capita income increased a stunning 21-fold over the last four decades, also lifting hundreds of millions out of income poverty. Yet it was not among the region's top performers in improving school enrollment and life expectancy.Nepal, a South Asian country, emerges as one of the world's fastest movers since 1970 mainly due to health and education achievements. Its present life expectancy is 25 years longer than in the 1970s. More than four of every five children of school age in Nepal now attend primary school, compared to just one in five 40 years ago. Hong Kong ranked highest among the countries grouped on the HDI (number 7 in the world, which is in the \"very high human development\" category), followed by Singapore (9), Japan (19) and South Korea (22). Afghanistan (155) ranked lowest amongst Asian countries out of the 169 countries assessed.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nAsia is home to several language families and many language isolates. Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken. For instance, according to Ethnologue, more than 700 languages are spoken in Indonesia, more than 400 languages spoken in India, and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines. China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.\n\n\n=== Religions ===\n\nMany of the world's major religions have their origins in Asia, including the five most practiced in the world (excluding irreligion), which are Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Chinese folk religion (classified as Confucianism and Taoism), and Buddhism. Asian mythology is complex and diverse.

Jews are the predominant ethnic group in Israel (75.6%) numbering at about 6.1 million, although the levels of adherence to Jewish religion vary. Outside of Israel there are small ancient Jewish communities in Turkey (17,400), Azerbaijan (9,100), Iran (8,756), India (5,000) and Uzbekistan (4,000), among many other places. In total, there are 14.4\u201317.5 million (2016, est.) Jews alive in the world today, making them one of the smallest Asian minorities, at roughly 0.3 to 0.4 percent of the total population of the continent.\nChristianity is a widespread religion in Asia with more than 286 million adherents according to Pew Research Center in 2010, and nearly 364 million according to Britannica Book of the Year 2014. Christians constitute around 12.6% of the total population of Asia. In the Philippines and East Timor, Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion; it was introduced by the Spaniards and the Portuguese, respectively. In Armenia and Georgia, Eastern Orthodoxy is the predominant religion. In the Middle East, such as in the Levant, Anatolia and Fars, Syriac Christianity (Church of the East) and Oriental Orthodoxy are prevalent minority denominations, which are both Eastern Christian sects mainly adhered to Assyrian people or Syriac Christians. Vibrant indigenous minorities in West Asia are adhering to the Eastern Catholic Churches and Eastern Orthodoxy. Saint Thomas Christians in India trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century. Significant Christian communities also found in Central Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia.Islam, which originated in the Hejaz located in modern-day Saudi Arabia, is the second largest and most widely-spread religion in Asia with at least 1 billion Muslims constituting around 23.8% of the total population of Asia. With 12.7% of the world Muslim population, the country currently with the largest Muslim population in the world is Indonesia, followed by Pakistan (11.5%), India (10%), Bangladesh, Iran and Turkey. Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are the three holiest cities for Islam in all the world. The Hajj and Umrah attract large numbers of Muslim devotees from all over the world to Mecca and Medina. Iran is the largest Shi'a country.\nThe Druze Faith or Druzism originated in West Asia, is a monotheistic religion based on the teachings of figures like Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad and Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, and Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. The number of Druze people worldwide is around one million. About 45% to 50% live in Syria, 35% to 40% live in Lebanon, and less than 10% live in Israel. Recently there has been a growing Druze diaspora.The Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith originated in Asia, in Iran (Persia), and spread from there to the Ottoman Empire, Central Asia, India, and Burma during the lifetime of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h.", "start_char_idx": 27518, "end_char_idx": 30869, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70fdfcfa-1414-4133-8ed0-58690e3b17fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "70fdfcfa-1414-4133-8ed0-58690e3b17fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Assam.txt", "file_name": "Assam.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 43160, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "311c4e3d-0332-477d-afe4-f0183750ff7f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Assam.txt", "file_name": "Assam.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 43160, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "cea1db871e9da45fbd4671c4178cfeb73ada1f46e7cefb3fb23e584bce97f458", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7e32e2be-5a1c-43da-ac32-e7b807132ca2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Assam.txt", "file_name": "Assam.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 43160, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "4818da66e0700c06343fcc8a5e55d47c876c00dfaf30edfcacce8e666e9e8cb0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "91c2d1ef-c699-451f-8884-4a3ba451882f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e55332a30e4aaff339458bc420e68c5bc2d22e30b38b66577e9c375b83bbdbb8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Recently there has been a growing Druze diaspora.The Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith originated in Asia, in Iran (Persia), and spread from there to the Ottoman Empire, Central Asia, India, and Burma during the lifetime of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h.

Lotus Temple is a big Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed temple in India.\n\n\n==== Indian and East Asian religions ====\nAlmost all Asian religions have philosophical character and Asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings. Indian philosophy includes Hindu philosophy and Buddhist philosophy. They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits, whereas another school of thought from India, C\u0101rv\u0101ka, preached the enjoyment of the material world. The religions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism originated in India, South Asia. In East Asia, particularly in China and Japan, Confucianism, Taoism and Zen Buddhism took shape.\nAs of 2012, Hinduism has around 1.1 billion adherents. The faith represents around 25% of Asia's population and is the largest religion in Asia. However, it is mostly concentrated in South Asia. Over 80% of the populations of both India and Nepal adhere to Hinduism, alongside significant communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Bali, Indonesia. Many overseas Indians in countries such as Burma, Singapore and Malaysia also adhere to Hinduism.\n\nBuddhism has a great following in mainland Southeast Asia and East Asia. Buddhism is the religion of the majority of the populations of Cambodia (96%), Thailand (95%), Burma (80\u201389%), Japan (36\u201396%), Bhutan (75\u201384%), Sri Lanka (70%), Laos (60\u201367%) and Mongolia (53\u201393%).

The Communist-governed countries of China, Vietnam and North Korea are officially atheist, thus the number of Buddhists and other religious adherents may be under-reported.\nJainism is found mainly in India and in overseas Indian communities such as the United States and Malaysia. Sikhism is found in Northern India and amongst overseas Indian communities in other parts of Asia, especially Southeast Asia. Confucianism is found predominantly in mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan and in overseas Chinese populations. Taoism is found mainly in mainland China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. In many Chinese communities, Taoism is easily syncretized with Mahayana Buddhism, thus exact religious statistics are difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated.", "start_char_idx": 30654, "end_char_idx": 33389, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91c2d1ef-c699-451f-8884-4a3ba451882f": {"__data__": {"id_": "91c2d1ef-c699-451f-8884-4a3ba451882f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Assam.txt", "file_name": "Assam.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 43160, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "311c4e3d-0332-477d-afe4-f0183750ff7f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Assam.txt", "file_name": "Assam.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 43160, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "cea1db871e9da45fbd4671c4178cfeb73ada1f46e7cefb3fb23e584bce97f458", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "70fdfcfa-1414-4133-8ed0-58690e3b17fc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Assam.txt", "file_name": "Assam.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 43160, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "7147763bf186579f9f12292625ceebcd3ab3d38f69933a65f6a97bea72612665", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d3f46b10-21c0-43db-8b69-f94e263bf2b5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "317ee4aaa879ff714e7114b852c302c178bff77a192345007b8dadbe08e75224", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Modern conflicts and events ==\nSome of the events pivotal in Asia related to the relationship with the outside world in the post-Second World War were:\n\nThe Partition of India (1947):Led to the creation of India and Pakistan, shaping the political landscape in South Asia.\n\nThe Indo-Pakistani War of 1947\u20131948:Fought over the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, setting the stage for future conflicts.\n\nThe Chinese Civil War (1927\u20131949):Culminated in the establishment of the People's Republic of China under the Communist Party.\n\nThe Korean War (1950\u20131953):Involved international forces and led to the division of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe First Indochina War (1946\u20131954):Ended with the defeat of French colonial forces and the partition of Vietnam.\n\nThe Vietnam War (1955\u20131975):A protracted conflict with significant global implications, especially during the Cold War.\n\nThe Sino-Vietnamese War (1979):Conflict between China and Vietnam following Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia.\n\nThe Indonesian occupation of East Timor (1975\u20131999):Involved Indonesia's annexation and subsequent independence through a UN-backed referendum.\n\nThe Soviet\u2013Afghan War (1979\u20131989):Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, contributing to the rise of the mujahideen.\n\nThe Iran\u2013Iraq War (1980\u20131988):Long-lasting conflict with regional and international implications.\n\nThe Gulf War (1990\u20131991):Resulted from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, with international intervention.\n\nThe Dissolution of the Soviet Union (1991):Marked the end of the Cold War and the emergence of independent states.\n\nThe War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021):U.S.-led intervention post-9/11 with long-lasting consequences.\n\nThe Iraq War (2003\u20132011):Led to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and subsequent instability.\n\nThe Arab Spring (2010\u20132012):Series of uprisings and protests across the Arab world, influencing regional dynamics.\n\nThe Syrian Civil War (2011\u2013present):Ongoing conflict with widespread humanitarian implications.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe culture of Asia is a diverse blend of customs and traditions that have been practiced by the various ethnic groups of the continent for centuries. The continent is divided into six geographic sub-regions: Central Asia, East Asia, North Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and West Asia. These regions are defined by their cultural similarities, including common religions, languages, and ethnicities. West Asia, also known as Southwest Asia or the Middle East, has cultural roots in the ancient civilizations of the Fertile Crescent and Mesopotamia, which gave rise to the Persian, Arab, Ottoman empires, as well as the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. These civilizations, which are located in the Hilly flanks, are among the oldest in the world, with evidence of farming dating back to around 9000 BCE. Despite the challenges posed by the vast size of the continent and the presence of natural barriers such as deserts and mountain ranges, trade and commerce have helped to create a Pan-Asian culture that is shared across the region.\n\n\n=== Nobel prizes ===\nThe polymath Rabindranath Tagore, a Bengali poet, dramatist, and writer from Santiniketan, now in West Bengal, India, became in 1913 the first Asian Nobel laureate.

Chandigarh constitutes the bulk of the Chandigarh Capital Region or Greater Chandigarh, which also includes the adjacent satellite cities of Panchkula in Haryana and Mohali in Punjab. It is situated near the foothills of the Himalayas, 260 km (162 miles) north of New Delhi and 229 km (143 miles) southeast of Amritsar.\nChandigarh is one of the earliest planned cities in post independence India and is internationally known for its architecture and urban design. The master plan of the city was prepared by Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier, which built upon earlier plans created by the Polish architect Maciej Nowicki and the American planner Albert Mayer. Most of the government buildings and housing in the city were designed by a team headed by Le Corbusier, Jane Drew and Maxwell Fry. Chandigarh's Capitol Complex\u2014as part of a global ensemble of Corbusier's buildings\u2014was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO at the 40th session of the World Heritage Conference in July 2016.Chandigarh has grown greatly since its initial construction, and has also driven the development of Mohali and Panchkula; the \"tri-city\" metropolitan area has a combined population of over 1,611,770. The city has one of the highest per capita incomes in the country. The union territory has one of the highest Human Development Index among Indian states and territories. In 2015, a survey by LG Electronics ranked it as the happiest city in India on the happiness index.  In 2015, an article published by BBC named Chandigarh one of the few master-planned cities in the world to have succeeded in terms of combining monumental architecture, cultural growth, and modernisation.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Chandigarh is a compound of Chandi and Garh. Chandi refers to the Hindu goddess Chandi and Garh means fortress. The name is derived from Chandi Mandir, an ancient temple devoted to the Hindu Goddess Chandi near the city in Panchkula District.The motif or sobriquet of \"The City of Beauty\" was derived from the City Beautiful movement, which was a popular philosophy in North American urban planning during the 1890s and 1900s. Architect Albert Mayer, the initial planner of Chandigarh, lamented the American rejection of City Beautiful concepts and declared, \"We want to create a beautiful city...\" The phrase was used as a logo in official publications in the 1970s and is now how the city describes itself.\n\n\n== History ==\nAs part of the partition of India in 1947, the former Indian province of Punjab was divided into two parts, the mostly Hindu and Sikh East Punjab in India, and the mostly Muslim West Punjab in Pakistan. The capital of undivided Punjab, Lahore, had become part of Pakistan after the partition. Instead of shifting the capital to an already existing and established city, Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, envisioned an altogether new and modern city to be built to serve as the capital of Punjab. Partap Singh Kairon, then the Chief Minister of East Punjab, and Edward Nirmal Mangat Rai, then the Chief Secretary of East Punjab, were instrumental in creating Chandigarh as the capital of the state. In 1949, the American planner and architect Albert Mayer was commissioned to design a new city to be called \"Chandigarh\".

The government carved out Chandigarh from about fifty Puadhi-speaking villages in the then-state of East Punjab, India. Shimla was the temporary capital of the state until Chandigarh was completed.\nAlbert Mayer developed a superblock-based city interspersed with green spaces, with an emphasis on cellular neighbourhoods and traffic segregation. His site plan took advantage of natural land characteristics; the land's gentle grade promoted proper drainage. Mayer stopped his work on the city after his architect-partner Matthew Nowicki died in a plane crash in 1950. Government officials recruited Le Corbusier to succeed Mayer and Nowicki, who utilised many elements of Mayer's original plan without attributing them to him.\nLe Corbusier designed many administration buildings, including the High Court, the Palace of Assembly, and the Secretariat Building. Le Corbusier also designed the general layout of the city, dividing it into sectors. Chandigarh hosts the largest of Le Corbusier's many Open Hand sculptures, standing 26 metres high. The Open Hand (La Main Ouverte) is a recurring motif in Le Corbusier's architecture, a sign for him of \"peace and reconciliation. It is open to give and open to receive.\" It represents what Le Corbusier called the \"Second Machine Age\". Two of the six monuments planned in the Capitol Complex which has the High Court, the Assembly, and the Secretariat, remain incomplete. These include Geometric Hill and Martyrs Memorial. Drawings were made, and they were begun in 1956, but they were never completed.The capital city was officially shifted from Shimla to Chandigarh on 21 September 1953, though Chandigarh was formally inaugurated by India's first president, Rajendra Prasad on 7 October 1953.\nDuring excavations at the time of the building of the city, some Indus Valley artefacts were discovered, suggesting that the area that is today Chandigarh was home to some settlements of the Indus Valley civilisation.\nOn 1 November 1966, after a long-drawn movement demanding the formation of a Punjabi state, the former state of Punjab was split in two. The western and northern mostly Punjabi-speaking portion became the present-day state of Punjab, while the eastern and southern Hindi- and Haryanvi-speaking areas became Haryana. Chandigarh ended up being located on the border of the two states, and both of them moved to incorporate the city into their respective territories. However, the city of Chandigarh was controlled directly by the central government and was to serve as the shared capital of the two states until a resolution could be reached.\nPresent-day Chandigarh was also the site of a short-lived late 18th-century principality, with a small fort at Mani Majra. As of 2016, many villages that predate the city are still inhabited within the modern blocks of some sectors, including Burail and Attawa, while several other such villages lie on the margins of the city.\n\n\n== Geography ==", "start_char_idx": 3335, "end_char_idx": 6401, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2637f944-3c7d-4757-b53e-134123bc447f": {"__data__": {"id_": "2637f944-3c7d-4757-b53e-134123bc447f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Chandigarh.txt", "file_name": "Chandigarh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 34235, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cd84742c-a6e4-4165-9a6c-2b925980936a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Chandigarh.txt", "file_name": "Chandigarh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 34235, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "48ccadb615c3b53b4b3841388085825778f5c69eed1a08982a0cf26f6cf11f23", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba7739e0-79e3-4cbe-a572-fd206b3e8a8b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Chandigarh.txt", "file_name": "Chandigarh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 34235, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "e131993a5c02bc77510570014154c46a76a5d88521627801821170e396cac9f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "63048e39-df89-433d-8f5b-bcb25b2b8046", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "53a98d0923c0ecf212c2819ebc1f5ecd0b06277adddcb751473089cb145273cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Present-day Chandigarh was also the site of a short-lived late 18th-century principality, with a small fort at Mani Majra.

However, the Punjab and Haryana High Court, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), the availability of an IT Park, and more than a hundred government schools provide other job opportunities to people.\nFour major trade promotion organisations have their offices in Chandigarh. These are The Associated Chambers of Commerce & Industry, ASSOCHAM India in Sector 8, Chandigarh, Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry, (FICCI) the PhD Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) which has its regional headquarters at Sector 31, Chandigarh.Chandigarh IT Park (also known as Rajiv Gandhi Chandigarh Technology Park) is the city's attempt to break into the information technology world. Chandigarh's infrastructure, proximity to Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, and Himachal Pradesh, and the IT talent pool attract IT businesses looking for office space in the area. Major Indian firms and multinational corporations like Quark, Infosys, EVRY, TechMahindra, Airtel, Amadeus IT Group, DLF have set up base in the city and its suburbs.\nThe work of the Chandigarh Metro was slated to start by 2019. It was opposed by the Member of Parliament from Chandigarh, Kirron Kher. With an estimated cost of around \u20b9109 billion including 50% funds from the governments of Punjab and Haryana and 25% from Chandigarh and government of India, funds from the Japanese government were proposed to include approximately 56% of the cost. However, the project was turned down owing to its non-feasibility. Kher promised a film city for Chandigarh. After winning the seat, she said that she had difficulty in acquiring land in Chandigarh. Her proposal was accepted by the Chandigarh Administration and the film city is proposed to be set up in Sarangpur, Chandigarh. This has been considered as a source of employment in the future.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nEvery year, in September or October during the festival of Navratri, many associations and organisations hold a Ramlila event, which has been conducted here for over 50 years.The Rose Festival in Zakir Hussain Rose Garden every February shows thousands of subspecies of roses.The Mango Festival is held during the monsoons, and other festivals are held at Sukhna Lake.\nPunjabi historic festivals like Lohri, Basant, Vaisakhi are also celebrated with great fervor and enthusiasm across the city.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nUnified Transport Metropolitan Authority, Chandigarh was made in 2023 to plan and execute the transportation needs of the Chandigarh Metropolitan Region.", "start_char_idx": 18601, "end_char_idx": 22200, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f50595aa-2222-430f-a225-13990a43013d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f50595aa-2222-430f-a225-13990a43013d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Chandigarh.txt", "file_name": "Chandigarh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 34235, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cd84742c-a6e4-4165-9a6c-2b925980936a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Chandigarh.txt", "file_name": "Chandigarh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 34235, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "48ccadb615c3b53b4b3841388085825778f5c69eed1a08982a0cf26f6cf11f23", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a473f509-334d-4755-87df-f787a28f7d01", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Chandigarh.txt", "file_name": "Chandigarh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 34235, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "1a8d730c27f1c7036b1c7e499f50c7b1a709ea7ed5b4a4fec4130cbe6c88df07", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "36beee05-a7d3-4c53-9b16-a30112955f29", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c525e0cb1d74a07a6a80fe792bd13384eef1620e1a169d86e4d81ebe0c927d15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Transport ==\nUnified Transport Metropolitan Authority, Chandigarh was made in 2023 to plan and execute the transportation needs of the Chandigarh Metropolitan Region.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nChandigarh has the largest number of vehicles per capita in India.

For Nehru, Chandigarh represented a vision of how a new planned city could be a canvas for the regeneration of the nation itself after centuries of oppression under British colonial rule and the dilution of Indian character from the nation's towns. Guided by the architectural optics of Le Corbusier, the development of Chandigarh was part of a state-driven exercise to break from the traditions of imperialism in city making and begin the process of healing from the injustices suffered.To the extent that Chandigarh epitomises the destructive influence of the British, in the impetus of its creation as a solution to the otherwise violent partitioning of territory between India and Pakistan, it represents an early ideological symbol for the birth of India's future. The selection of the physical site involved an extensive vetting process. Many existing towns in Punjab were surveyed as options for the new capital and dismissed for poor performance concerning factors such as military defensibility and capacity for accommodating potential refugee influxes. The construction of a new town in Chandigarh was determined to be the best option due to its relative strength in these factors as well as its proximity to the national capital, New Delhi, its central location within the state of Punjab, its abundance of fecund land and its beautiful natural landscape.\n\n\n=== Modernism in new town design ===\nOff the back of this conflation of assets Chandigarh then was well poised to serve a function as a city-building project in national identity. From a federal policy perspective, the development of the new town became a tool in India for modernisation and an intended driver of economic activity, legal reform, and regional growth as well as a significant agent for the decolonisation project. As Britain's grip on their empire began to weaken their accelerated withdrawal between the beginning of the second world war and 1947 left their former colony in states of disarray and disorganisation, and policymakers for the new Indian government were required to contend with issues such as rapid rural depopulation, urban congestion, and poverty. As well as in Chandigarh this policy tool was implemented in the creation of new capital cities in Bhubaneswar and Gandhinagar, and more broadly throughout India in the 112 planned cities created between independence and 1971, purposed to absorb migration from those regions in demise after being abandoned by the British and provide hubs for growing industries such as in steel and energy.These examples from a genealogy of utopian urban forms developed in post-independence India as a panacea for issues related to underdevelopment as well as post-independence complications to do with separatist religious conflict and the resulting diplomatic tensions.

These \"urban utopias\" attempt to enforce nation-building policies through a federalised rule of law at a regional level, and diffuse postcolonial urbanism which codes justice in its design. The intent is that the economic success and progressivism of cities such as Chandigarh as a lightning rod for social change would gradually be emulated at the scale of the nation. Chandigarh was for Nehru and Le Corbusier an embodiment of the egalitarian potential offered by modernism, where the machine age would complete the liberation of the nation's citizens through the productive capacity of industrial technology and the relative ease of constructing civic facilities such as dams, hospitals, and schools; the very antithesis of the conservative and traditional legacy of colonialism. Though built as a state capital Chandigarh came to be focused on industry and higher education. The specialisation of these new towns in particular functions represents a crucial aspect of the modernisation process as a decolonising enterprise, in completing a national portfolio where each town forms a part of the utopian model for contemporary India.\nThe post-colonialism of Chandigarh is rooted in the transformation of the political ideas of those such as Nehru who generated a new Indian nationalism through the design of newly built forms. Scholars such as Edward Said have emphasised the sinister nature of nostalgia and the romanticisation of colonial architecture in newly independent colonies as artefacts that perpetuate the ideological legacy of the hegemony and replicate the hierarchy of power even after decolonisation. Insofar as modernism in architecture (which defined town planning under the Nehru era of rule) represents an active radical break from tradition and a colonial past even the very presence of Le Corbusier has been recognised as an indelible resistance to the British construction legacy, as he provided the first non-British influence on design thinking in India, enabling a generational shift in the contemporary cohort of architects and planners to be hired by the state throughout the rest of the century who were initiated under Modernist conditioning.As early as the 1950s the presence of the International Style could be detected in the design of houses in India, \"whether mistri or architect-designed\". The development of low-cost housing was a priority for Chandigarh, and the modern forms designed by Corbusier are characterised by a dispensing with colonial forms focused on classic aesthetics and a refocusing on strategies such as using narrow frontages and orientation for minimising direct exposure to the sun and maximising natural ventilation and efficient cost while providing modern amenities in the International Style aesthetic. These developments are credited as the beginning of a \"Chandigarh architecture\", inspiring gradual experimentation with form and an \"Indianising\" of the International Style which precipitated the formation of the country's new cultural identity in town design.", "start_char_idx": 29039, "end_char_idx": 32154, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19cbe4b0-2a47-4833-a2cd-da500897246a": {"__data__": {"id_": "19cbe4b0-2a47-4833-a2cd-da500897246a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Chandigarh.txt", "file_name": "Chandigarh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 34235, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cd84742c-a6e4-4165-9a6c-2b925980936a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Chandigarh.txt", "file_name": "Chandigarh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 34235, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "48ccadb615c3b53b4b3841388085825778f5c69eed1a08982a0cf26f6cf11f23", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "25ef52bb-5a44-4cac-a3ff-f688e6569a96", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Chandigarh.txt", "file_name": "Chandigarh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 34235, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "864287f56eedd1f20e2d292da86693d1b0307c8e20d82b25bc99c7d7f863fbf0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2d43c2ed-f43b-407c-bd23-8f05a3e40c32", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e31be7c1fa424abd85b2c15a6e2a58ef4173c32d230724d79080d23ab970d222", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These developments are credited as the beginning of a \"Chandigarh architecture\", inspiring gradual experimentation with form and an \"Indianising\" of the International Style which precipitated the formation of the country's new cultural identity in town design.\n\n\n=== Criticisms ===\nCriticisms are well established regarding the implementation of the postcolonial vision of Nehru and Le Corbusier and the critical emphasis on its influence. Claims have been made that the focus on Corbusier's architect-centred discourse erases the plural authorship of the narrative of Chandigarh's development, arguing that it was, in fact, a hybridity of values and of \"contested modernities\" of Western and indigenous Indian origin and cultural exchanges rather than an uncontested administrative enterprise. Such criticism is consistent with claims that decolonisation in India has marked a shift from segregation based on race to segregation based on class and that planned cities are truly \"designed\" ones which represent the values and interests of a westernised middle-class Indian elite which ignore the complexities of India's diverse ethnic and cultural landscape and enabled neocolonial hierarchies such as the imposition of the Hindi language on non-conforming castes.Brent C. Brolin argues that Le Corbusier ignored Indian preferences in designing the housing and communities and that the residents have done what they can to recreate their accustomed lifestyle. Furthermore, the early over-saturation of the minimalist International Style in building design in Chandigarh has attracted criticisms of effecting a \"democratic, self-effacing banality\", though this criticism is perhaps negligent of how this was necessary for galvanising higher standards of urban living throughout the country.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Villages ==\nKhuda Jassu\n\n\n== See also ==\nAmbala Chandigarh Expressway\nChandigarh capital region\nList of tourist attractions in Chandigarh\nMohali\nNew Chandigarh, Punjab\nPanchkula\nPinjore\nKaimbwala\nNavyug Ramlila and Dussehra Committee\nEmblem of Chandigarh\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nGovernmentThe Official Website of Chandigarh AdministrationGeneral informationChandigarh at Curlie\n Geographic data related to Chandigarh at OpenStreetMap", "start_char_idx": 31894, "end_char_idx": 34188, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d43c2ed-f43b-407c-bd23-8f05a3e40c32": {"__data__": {"id_": "2d43c2ed-f43b-407c-bd23-8f05a3e40c32", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Chhattisgarh.txt", "file_name": "Chhattisgarh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49564, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "01302345-f0c2-43ee-b611-179fce1e4868", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Chhattisgarh.txt", "file_name": "Chhattisgarh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49564, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "fe8723a039b2af8bcd17dcc4d568174dbe781584e9ce54ca86e7302b0bea5361", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "19cbe4b0-2a47-4833-a2cd-da500897246a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Chandigarh.txt", "file_name": "Chandigarh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 34235, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "c9c84e4c242ea8c20b3f9227df25ee8029176f1edb01b054dea135e15068092d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b7f01c66-67ae-4090-95f1-ded40d3bf84e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a5b10ed2f62c86e7f7b0408764ea0a6e843d3d0acf1f008fc734d5a4af039523", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Chhattisgarh (, Hindi: [\u02c8t\u0283\u02b0\u0259t\u032a\u02d0i\u02d0sg\u0259\u027d\u02b1]) is a landlocked state in Central India.

The old state had 36 demesnes (feudal territories): Ratanpur, Vijaypur, Kharound, Maro, Kautgarh, Nawagarh, Sondhi, Aukhar, Padarbhatta, Semriya, Champa, Lafa, Chhuri, Kenda, Matin, Aparora, Pendra, Kurkuti-kandri, Raipur, Patan, Simaga, Singarpur, Lavan, Omera, Durg, Saradha, Sirasa, Menhadi, Khallari, Sirpur, Figeswar, Rajim, Singhangarh, Suvarmar, Tenganagarh and Akaltara. However, most historians disagree with this theory as 36 forts have not been found and identified.\nAccording to the opinion of Hiralal, it is said that at one time there were 36 strongholds in this area, that is why its name was Chhattisgarh. But even after the increase in the number of strongholds, there was no change in the name, Chhattisgarh is the State of India which has been given the status of 'Mahtari' (Mother). There are two regions in India which are named for special reasons \u2013 one was 'Magadha' which became \"Bihar\" due to the abundance of Buddhism viharas and the other was 'Dakshina Kosala' which became \"Chhattisgarh\" due to the inclusion of thirty-six strongholds.Another view, more popular with experts and historians, is that Chhattisgarh is the corrupted form of Chedisgarh meaning Raj or \"Empire of the Chedis\". In ancient times, Chhattisgarh region had been part of the Chedi dynasty of Kalinga, in modern Odisha. In the medieval period up to 1803, a major portion of present eastern Chhattisgarh was part of the Sambalpur Kingdom of Odisha.\n\n\n== History ==", "start_char_idx": 1041, "end_char_idx": 2987, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9dc03231-e1af-4723-b012-911f3d289340": {"__data__": {"id_": "9dc03231-e1af-4723-b012-911f3d289340", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Chhattisgarh.txt", "file_name": "Chhattisgarh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49564, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "01302345-f0c2-43ee-b611-179fce1e4868", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Chhattisgarh.txt", "file_name": "Chhattisgarh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49564, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "fe8723a039b2af8bcd17dcc4d568174dbe781584e9ce54ca86e7302b0bea5361", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b7f01c66-67ae-4090-95f1-ded40d3bf84e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Chhattisgarh.txt", "file_name": "Chhattisgarh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49564, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "3d1cff9dcd01afe711f34be219bfe4ca9ef68940e184ef804952f8a22781df93", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a4da3571-26a9-4934-ab9c-cbb909d8f1e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d9ee8969fefb2f952817b21a2e37eaa47aec06560b9fde3913c47d1bf32d698e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient and medieval history ===\nSitabengra caves are one of the earliest examples of theatre architecture in India located on Ramgarh hill of Chhattisgarh dated to Mauryan period of 3rd century BCE.

The inscription can be translated as either a love proclamation by a girl or a dancer-painter creating a cave theatre together. In ancient times, this region was known as Dakshina Kosala. This area is also mentioned in Ramayana and Mahabharata. One of the earliest statues of Vishnu has been excavated from Shunga period site at Malhar. \n\nBetween the sixth and twelfth centuries, Sharabhpurias, Panduvanshis (of Mekala and Dakshina Kosala), Somavanshi, Kalachuri and Nagavanshi rulers dominated this region. The Bastar region of Chhattisgarh was invaded by Rajendra Chola I and Kulothunga Chola I of the Chola dynasty in the 11th century.Eventually most of Chhattisgarh was consolidated under the Haihaiyavanshi Kingdom, who ruled central Chhattisgarh and held smaller kingdoms like Kanker under their authority. The Haihaiyavanshis continued to rule the region for 700 years until they were invaded by the Marathas in 1740 and came under their authority. Chhattisgarh was directly annexed to the Maratha Nagpur Kingdom in 1758 on the death of Mohan Singh, the last independent ruler of Chhattisgarh.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nChhattisgarh was under Maratha Rule (Bhonsles of Nagpur) from 1741 to 1845.

Several all-party platforms were created and usually resolved around petitions, public meetings, seminars, rallies and strikes. The demand was raised by the Raipur Congress unit in 1924 and was also discussed in the Indian Congress at Tripuri. A discussion about forming a Regional Congress organisation for Chhattisgarh took place. In 1954, when the State Reorganisation Commission was set up, the demand was put forward but was rejected. In 1955, the demand was raised in the Nagpur assembly of Madhya Bharat.In the 1990s, the demand became more prominent, resulting in the formation of a statewide political forum known as the Chhattisgarh Rajya Nirman Manch. The forum was led by Chandulal Chadrakar and several successful region-wide strikes and rallies were organised under it, all of which were supported by major political parties, such as the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party.The new National Democratic Alliance government sent the Separate Chhattisgarh Bill for approval by the Madhya Pradesh Assembly, where it was unanimously approved and then submitted to the Lok Sabha. The bill was passed in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, which allowed the creation of the state of Chhattisgarh. K. R.

The Rihand River, a tributary of the Ganges, drains this area. The eastern end of the Satpura Range and the western edge of the Chota Nagpur Plateau form an east\u2013west belt of hills that divide the Mahanadi River basin from the Indo-Gangetic plain.

This area has extensive rice cultivation. The upper Mahanadi basin is separated from the upper Narmada basin to the west by the Maikal Hills (part of the Satpuras) and from the plains of Odisha to the east by ranges of hills. The southern part of the state lies on the Deccan plateau, in the watershed of the Godavari River and its tributary, the Indravati River. The Mahanadi is the chief river of the state.

About 80% of the population of the state is rural and the main livelihood of the villagers is agriculture and agriculture-based small industry.\nThe majority of the farmers are still practicing the traditional methods of cultivation, resulting in low growth rates and productivity. The farmers have to be made aware of modern technologies suitable to their holdings. Providing adequate knowledge to the farmers is essential for a better implementation of the agricultural development plans and to improve productivity.Considering this and a very limited irrigated area, the productivity of not only rice but also other crops is low, hence the farmers are unable to obtain economic benefits from agriculture and it has remained as subsistence agriculture till now.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Agricultural products ====\nThe main crops are rice, maize, kodo-kutki and other small millets and pulses (tuar and kulthi); oilseeds, such as groundnuts (peanuts), soybeans and sunflowers, are also grown.

Only about 20% of the area is under irrigation; the rest depends on rain. Of the three agroclimatic zones, about 73% of the Chhattisgarh plains, 97% of the Bastar plateau and 95% of the northern hills are rainfed. The irrigated area available for double cropping is only 87,000 ha in Chhattisgarh plains and 2300 ha in Bastar plateau and northern hills. Due to this, the productivity of rice and other crops is low, hence the farmers are unable to obtain economic benefits from agriculture and it has remained as subsistence agriculture till now, though agriculture is the main occupation of more than 80% of the population.In Chhattisgarh region, about 22% of net cropped area was under irrigation as compared to 36.5% in Madhya Pradesh in 1998\u201399, whereas the average national irrigation was about 40%. The irrigation is characterised by a high order of variability ranging from 1.6% in Bastar to 75.0% in Dhamtari. Based on an average growth trend in the irrigated area, about 0.43% additional area is brought under irrigation every year as compared to 1.89% in Madhya Pradesh and 1.0% in the country as a whole. Thus, irrigation has been growing at a very low rate in Chhattisgarh and the pace of irrigation is so slow, it would take about 122 years to reach the 75% level of net irrigated area in Chhattisgarh at the present rate of growth.Chhattisgarh has a limited irrigation system, with dams and canals on some rivers. Average rainfall in the state is around 1400 mm and the entire state falls under the rice agroclimatic zone. The Large variation in the yearly rainfall directly affects the production of rice. Irrigation is the prime need of the state for its overall development and therefore the state government has given top priority to development of irrigation.A total of four major, 33 medium and 2199 minor irrigation projects have been completed and five major, nine medium and 312 minor projects are under construction, as of 31 March 2006.\n\n\n=== Industrial sector ===", "start_char_idx": 14994, "end_char_idx": 17086, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8524b25-b950-4a53-8667-5fa618d59fba": {"__data__": {"id_": "d8524b25-b950-4a53-8667-5fa618d59fba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Chhattisgarh.txt", "file_name": "Chhattisgarh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49564, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "01302345-f0c2-43ee-b611-179fce1e4868", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Chhattisgarh.txt", "file_name": "Chhattisgarh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49564, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "fe8723a039b2af8bcd17dcc4d568174dbe781584e9ce54ca86e7302b0bea5361", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1634c1ee-e5a8-444c-9d6b-dda946c88625", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Chhattisgarh.txt", "file_name": "Chhattisgarh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49564, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "6d61989b011bdedbc305c95d3de0060f5112d0e779911e1ba54d1c1ecea4614d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fdf7cb5b-2a84-4ccb-b353-f89f42580b4c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8efb715197d2f4941e377f41692988eaa9bdd95bfeb0ddba86f7dea103b412af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Industrial sector ===\n\n\n==== Power sector ====\nChhattisgarh is one of the few states of India where the power sector is effectively developed. Based on the current production of surplus electric power, the position of the State is comfortable and profitable. The Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board (CSEB) is in a strong position to meet the electricity requirement of the state and is in good financial health. According to Central Electricity Authority (CEA), Chhattisgarh provides electricity to several other states because of surplus production.In Chhattisgarh, National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (|NTPC) has Sipat Thermal Power Station with a capacity of 2,980 MW at Sipat, Bilaspur; LARA Super Thermal Power Station with a nameplate capacity of 1600MW and Korba Super Thermal Power Station with a capacity of 2,600 MW at Korba, while CSEB's units have a thermal capacity of 1,780 MW and hydel capacity of 130 MW. Apart from NTPC and CSEB, there are a number of private generation units of large and small capacity. The state government has pursued a liberal policy with regard to captive generation which has resulted in a number of private companies coming up.The state has a potential of 61,000 MW of additional thermal power in terms of availability of coal for more than 100 years and more than 2,500 MW hydel capacity.

Therefore, extraction is mainly amenable to underground mining except a few blocks in eastern part of these coalfields which have opencast potential.Jhilimili Coalfield located in Surguja district is spread over an area of 180 square kilometres (69 sq mi). Estimated total reserves are 215.31 million tonnes, out of which about half have been indicated to be Grade I. According to the Geological Survey of India, total reserves of non-coking coal (as of 1 January 2004) in Jhilimili Coalfield (up to a depth of 300m) was 267.10 million tonnes.The Sonhat is a large coal field representing one of the largest coal reserves in India having estimated reserves of 2.67 billion tonnes of coal.Bisrampur coal field represents one of the largest coal reserves in India having estimated reserves of 1.61 billion tonnes of coal. Chirimiri Coalfield is located in the valley of the Hasdeo River, a tributary of the Mahanadi. Opened in 1930 with production starting in 1932, and has been owned by several companies and owners such as Chirimiri Colliery Company Pvt. Ltd., Dababhoy's New Chirimiri Ponri Hill Company (Private) Limited, United Collieries Limited, K.N. Dhady and Indra Singh & Sons (Private) Limited.

It has the highest output of coal in the country with second-highest reserves. It is third in iron ore production and first in tin production. Limestone, dolomite and bauxite are abundant. It is the only tin ore-producing state in India. Other commercially extracted minerals include corundum, garnet, quartz, marble, alexandrite and diamonds.\nRowghat iron ore deposits are located in the Antagarh Tahsil of Kanker district and contain the largest iron ore deposits after the Bailadila Iron Ore Mine. Rowghat Mines' reserves have been assessed at 731.93 Mn tonnes. Bailadila has reserves assessed at 1.343 Bn tonnes. Iron ore deposits in Rowghat were discovered in 1899 and in 1949 Geological Survey of India investigated the area.\nRowghat deposit is 29 km (18 mi) NNW of Narayanpur, and about 140 km (87 mi) from Jagdalpur. Fe content varies in the various blocks - A Block (62.58% Fe), B Block (50.29% Fe), C Block (57.00% Fe), D Block (60.00% Fe), E Block (52.93% Fe),and F Block (59.62% Fe).\n\n\n=== Information and technologies ===\nIn recent years, Chhattisgarh is also receiving exposure in information technology (IT) projects and consultancy.

The Average Literacy rate in Chhattisgarh for Urban regions was 84.05 percent in which males were 90.58% literate while female literacy stood at 73.39%. Total literates in the urban region of Chhattisgarh were 4,370,966.Among the marginalized groups, STs are at the bottom of the rankings, further emphasizing the lack of social development in the state. Bastar and Dantewada in south Chhattisgarh are the most illiterate districts and the dropout ratio is the highest among all the districts. The reason for this is the extreme poverty in rural areas.\nRamakrishna Mission Asharama Narainpur serves the tribals at the abhjhmad jungle region of Chhattisgarh for their upliftment and education.As per census 2011, the State has population of 25.5 million and six medical colleges ( five Government and one private) with intake capacity of 700 students and doctor patient ratio of 1:17,000.\nUnder The NITI Aayog released Health Index report titled, \"Healthy States, Progressive India\", Chhattisgarh has an index of 52.02 Out of 100, which is better than states such as Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Odisha, Bihar, Assam and Uttar Pradesh.Despite different health-related schemes and programs, the health indicators such as the percentage of women with BMI<18.5, Under Five Mortality Rate and underweight children, are poor. This may be due to the difficulty in accessing the remote areas in the state. The prevalence of female malnutrition in Chhattisgarh is higher than the national average\u2014half of the ST females are malnourished. The performance of SCs is a little better than the corresponding national and state average. The Under Five Mortality Rate among STs is significantly higher than the national average.\n\n\n=== Net state domestic product ===\nChhattisgarh is one of the emerging states with relatively high growth rates of net state domestic product (NSDP) (8.2% vs. 7.1% All India over 2002\u20132008) and per capita NSDP (6.2% vs. 5.4% All India over 2002\u20132008). The growth rates of the said parameters are above the national averages and thus it appears that Chhattisgarh is catching up with other states in this respect. However, the state still has very low levels of per capita income as compared to the other states.\n\n\n=== Urbanisation ===\nOut of the total population of Chhattisgarh, 23.24% live in urban regions. The total population living in urban areas is 5,937,237, of which 3,035,469 are males and the remaining 2,901,768 are females.\nRaipur, Durg, Bhilai Nagar, Bilaspur, Korba, Jagdalpur, Rajnandgaon, Ambikapur and Raigarh are some of the urban towns and cities in the region.\n\n\n=== Sex ratio ===\nThere are more than 13 million males and 12.9  million females in Chhattisgarh, which constitutes 2.11% of the country's population.

Scheduled Tribes make up 30.62% of the population. The tribals are an important part of the state population and mainly inhabit the dense forests of Bastar and other districts of south Chhattisgarh. The percentage increase in the population of the scheduled list of tribals during the 2001\u20132011 decade had been at the rate of 18.23%. The Scheduled Caste (SC) population of Chhattisgarh is 2,418,722 as per 2001 census constituting 11.6 percent of the total population (20,833,803). The proportion of Scheduled Castes has increased from 11.6 percent in 2001 to 12.8% in 2011.\n\n\n=== Poverty ===\nThe incidence of poverty in Chhattisgarh is very high. The estimated poverty ratio in 2004\u201305 based on uniform reference period consumption was around 50 per cent, which is approximately double the all India level. The incidence of poverty in the rural and urban areas is almost the same.\nMore than half of the rural STs and urban SCs are poor. In general, the proportion of poor SC and ST households in the state is higher than the state average and their community's respective national averages (except for rural SC households). Given that more than 50 percent of the state's population is ST and SC, the high incidence of income poverty among them is a matter of serious concern in the state.\nThis indicates that the good economic performance in recent years has not percolated to this socially deprived group, which is reflected in their poor performance in human development indicators.\n\n\n=== Access to drinking water ===\nIn terms of access to improved drinking water sources, at the aggregate level, Chhattisgarh fared better than the national average and the SCs of the state performed better than the corresponding national average. Scheduled Tribes are marginally below the state average, but still better than the STs at the all India level.\nThe proportion of households with access to improved sources of drinking water in 2008\u201309 was 91%. This proportion was over 90% even in states like Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. This was largely because these states had over 70% of their households accessing tube wells/hand-pumps as sources of drinking water.", "start_char_idx": 29226, "end_char_idx": 31855, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ccf6180-e094-469a-bb17-ebd650e47d59": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ccf6180-e094-469a-bb17-ebd650e47d59", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Chhattisgarh.txt", "file_name": "Chhattisgarh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49564, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "01302345-f0c2-43ee-b611-179fce1e4868", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Chhattisgarh.txt", "file_name": "Chhattisgarh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49564, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "fe8723a039b2af8bcd17dcc4d568174dbe781584e9ce54ca86e7302b0bea5361", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5b4612b5-2c01-4001-97db-a976f06543bd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Chhattisgarh.txt", "file_name": "Chhattisgarh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49564, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "c682d2a611c39a077eea5086ba4c2f58b7f7c3499eb484cb2567d1a06390a34c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a88fca4d-f77a-44bb-a59d-154659a9d4c1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "193f2cc426250a17073e222754e82cb273da1a5c66d7a0838aa3dec71a8749b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Sanitation ===\nSanitation facilities in the state were abysmally low with only about 41 percent having toilet facilities before the Swachh Bharat Mission was Launched by the Government of India. The Urban areas of Chhattisgarh attained the title of open defecation free on 2 October 2017 and the rural areas have achieved a 90.31% sanitation coverage. What sets Chhattisgarh apart from other states of India is an approach to bring in behavioural change in order to get open defecation free status.

But due to development of new technology the teledensity in 2017 is 68.08 percent which shows improvement of telecom infrastructure. On the other hand, for states like Delhi and Himachal Pradesh and metropolitan cities like Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai, teledensity was over 100 percent in 2010 implying that individuals have more than one telephone connection.\n\n\n=== Road density ===\nThe total density of National Highways (NHs) in Chhattisgarh is at 23.4 km per 1,000 km2 out of the total length of 3,168 km in the State, the Central Government has informed.\nChhattisgarh Government had completed construction of 5,266 cement concrete (CC) roads having a total length of 1,530 km in various villages of the State as on 31 May 2016 under 'Mukhyamantri Gram Sadak Yojana'.\n\n\n=== Witchcraft ===\nTo bring about social reforms and with a view to discourage undesirable social practices, Chhattisgarh government has enacted the Chhattisgarh Tonhi Atyachar (Niwaran) Act, 2005 against witchery. Much has to be done on the issue of law enforcement by judicial authorities to protect women in this regard, bringing such persecution to an end.Some sections of tribal population of Chhattisgarh state believe in witchcraft. Women are believed to have access to supernatural forces and are accused of being witches (tonhi) often to settle personal scores.\nAs of 2010, they are still hounded out of villages on the basis of flimsy accusations by male village sorcerers paid to do so by villagers with personal agendas, such as property and goods acquisition.

Chhattisgarhi, a variety of eastern Hindi, is spoken and understood by the majority of people in Chhattisgarh and is the dominant language in the Chhattisgarh plain. Chhattisgarhi is called Khaltahi by tribals and Laria in Odia. Chhattisgarhi is itself divided into many dialects, one of the most distinct being Surgujia from the Surguja region, which is sometimes considered its own language. Near the Uttar Pradesh border this dialect merges into Bhojpuri, while it merges with Bagheli near the Madhya Pradesh border. Surgujia also merges into Sadri in the northeast along the border with Jharkhand. Hindi is spoken by many migrants from outside the state, and is a major language in the cities and industrial centres, while many whose dialect is actually Chhattisgarhi record their speech as Hindi in the census. Odia is widely-spoken in eastern Chhattisgarh especially near the Odisha border. Telugu and Marathi speaking minorities can be found along the Telangana and Maharashtra borders respectively. In the eastern Bastar region, Halbi and Bhatri are major languages.\nIn addition, Chhattisgarh has several tribal languages. Kurukh and Korwa are both spoken in the Surguja region. Gondi is a major language in southern Chhattisgarh: Bastar and the adjoining districts.

Although this ratio is small compared to other states, it is unique in India because Chhattisgarh is the 10th-largest state in India.\nThe gender ratio (number of females per 1,000 males) has been steadily declining over 20th century in Chhattisgarh. But it is conspicuous that Chhattisgarh always had a better female-to-male ratio compared with national average.\n\nRural women, although poor, are independent, better organised, and socially outspoken. According to another local custom, women can choose to terminate a marriage relationship through a custom called chudi pahanana, if she desires. Most of the old temples and shrines follow Shaktism and are goddess-centric (e.g., Shabari, Mahamaya, Danteshwari) and the existence of these temples gives insight into historical and current social fabric of this state. However, a mention of these progressive local customs in no way suggests that the ideology of female subservience does not exist in Chhattisgarh.

They lived more than 10 of their 14 years of Vanvas in different places of Chhattisgarh. One of the remarkable places is Shivrinarayan which is nearby Bilaspur district of Chhattisgarh. Shivrinarayan was named after an old lady Shabari. When Ram visited Shabari she said \"I do not have anything to offer other than my heart, but here are some berry fruits. May it please you, my Lord.\" Saying so, Shabari offered the fruits she had meticulously collected to Rama. When Rama was tasting them, Lakshmana raised the concern that Shabari had already tasted them and therefore unworthy of eating. To this Rama said that of the many types of food he had tasted, \"nothing could equal these berry fruits, offered with such devotion. You taste them, then alone will you know.

It is composed of two separate geographical entities: Nagar Haveli, wedged in between Maharashtra and Gujarat states 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) to the north-west, and the smaller enclave of Dadra, which is surrounded by Gujarat. Silvassa is the administrative headquarters of Dadra and Nagar Haveli.\nUnlike the surrounding areas, Dadra and Nagar Haveli was ruled by the Portuguese from 1783 until the mid-20th century. The area was captured by pro-India forces in 1954 and administered as the de facto state of Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli before being accessioned to India as a union territory, the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli in 1961. The union territory was merged with the neighbouring union territory of Daman and Diu to form the new union territory of \"Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu\" on 26 January 2020. The territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli then became one of the three districts of the new union territory, as the Dadra and Nagar Haveli district.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Portuguese era ===\nThe history of Dadra and Nagar Haveli begins with the defeat of the Koli chieftains of the region by the Rajput kings. In the year 1262, a Rajput prince from Rajasthan named Ram Singh established himself as the ruler of Ramnagar, the present-day Dharampur, which consisted of 8 parganas (a group of villages) and assumed the title Maharana. Nagar Haveli was one of the Parganas, and its capital was Silvassa.\nIn 1360, Rana Dharamshah shifted his capital from Nagar Haveli to Nagar Fatehpur.\nWith the rise of Maratha power, Shivaji Maharaj viewed Ramnagar as an important locality. He captured the region, but Somshah Rana recaptured it in 1690.\nAfter the Treaty of Vasai (6 May 1739), Vasai and the surrounding territories came under the Maratha rule.Soon after, the Marathas captured Ramnagar but reinstated the ruler, Ramdeo, under conditions. Thus the Marathas acquired the rights to collect revenue, known as chauthai. from Nagar Haveli and two other Parganas.\nDuring the time of Dharamdeo, the son of Ramdeo, due to his change of policies (he neglected the conditions imposed earlier by the Marathas), the Marathas captured Nagar Haveli and the surrounding region.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2313, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ccf5d62-275d-4597-8e1e-1ebdaef68785": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ccf5d62-275d-4597-8e1e-1ebdaef68785", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Dadar_and_Nagar_Haveli.txt", "file_name": "Dadar_and_Nagar_Haveli.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25362, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "388c5558-d566-4ed4-a76b-6fd38e8e18ba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Dadar_and_Nagar_Haveli.txt", "file_name": "Dadar_and_Nagar_Haveli.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25362, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "95e6087948b636a612a1c486cfb4f66481ccbc0e60c855f24ff4756116e6a828", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "66044249-362f-45ff-a55f-acfa8bb039ea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Dadar_and_Nagar_Haveli.txt", "file_name": "Dadar_and_Nagar_Haveli.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25362, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "cfb9487afb9c84057a203e997a82eb3bd996cb6fae745c260b801ea1275ed5dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "180a2f6c-c38b-42c2-b03b-ba3a2307704c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "33f99851d7c0ce272f778720ff729810b40952028473a8ecf53a561d940dc005", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Portuguese era ===\n\nThe Portuguese were granted the area of Nagar Haveli on 10 June 1783 on the basis of the Friendship Treaty executed on 17 December 1779 as compensation for damage to the Portuguese frigate Santana by the Maratha Navy in 1772. The treaty allowed the Portuguese to collect revenue from 72 villages in Nagar Haveli. Then, in 1785 the Portuguese purchased Dadra, annexing it to Portuguese State of India (Estado Portugu\u00eas da \u00cdndia).\nIn 1818, the Maratha Empire was defeated by the British in the Third Anglo-Maratha War, and the Portuguese ultimately became the effective rulers of Dadra and Nagar Haveli.\nUnder the Portuguese rule, Dadra and Nagar Haveli were part of the Distrito de Dam\u00e3o (Daman district) of the Estado da \u00cdndia (Portuguese State of India). The two territories formed a single concelho (municipality), named \"Nagar Haveli\", with its head in Darar\u00e1 until 1885 and, after that, with its head in the town of Silvassa. The local affairs were overseen by an elected c\u00e2mara municipal (municipal council), with the higher level affairs administrated by the district governor of Daman, who was represented in Nagar Haveli by an administrator.\nThe Nagar Haveli concelho was itself divided in the following freguesias (civil parishes): Silvassa, Noroli, Dadra, Quelalunim, Rand\u00e1, Darar\u00e1, Cadoli, Canoel, Carchonde, and Sindonim.\nThe Portuguese occupation lasted until 1954, when Dadra and Nagar Haveli were liberated by supporters of the Indian Union. It was the first possession to be detached from the colonial Empire by the integration with the Indian Union in 1954, after nearly two centuries of Colonial rule.\n\n\n=== End of Portuguese rule ===\n\nAfter India attained independence in 1947, the residents of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, with the help of volunteers of organisations like the United Front of Goans (UFG), the National Movement Liberation Organisation (NMLO), and the Azad Gomantak Dal, conquered the territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli from Portuguese India in 1954.As time passed, the Indian independence struggle picked up momentum. On 18 June 1946, Ram Manohar Lohia was arrested in Goa. This was the beginning of the independence struggle in Goa. He was deported to India. On 15 August 1947, India became independent from British rule, but the Portuguese and other European colonies were not immediately incorporated.\nThe Goan struggle continued for many years. Atmaram Narsinh Karmalkar, an officer in the Banco Colonial (Portuguese Bank) at Panaji (in Goa) (then known as Panjim), who was popularly known as Appasaheb Karmalkar, was indirectly involved in the freedom struggle in Goa.

D'Souza, Waman Desai and others were also attempting the liberation of DNH.\nOn 18 June 1954, many leaders met at Lavachha. Lavachha and Vapi were Indian territories. The order in which these places lie (from east to west) is Nagar Haveli, Lavachha, Dadra, Vapi and Daman (on the sea coast). So Portuguese officers required transit permits through the Indian territories of Lavachha and Vapi to travel between N.H., Dadra, and Daman.\nOn the night of 22 July 1954, 15 volunteers of the United Front of Goans under the leadership of Francis Mascerenhas and Waman Desai sneaked into the territory of Dadra and reached the police station. There were only three personnel at the police station. One was attacked with a knife by one of the volunteers, and the other two were overpowered. The Indian tricolour was hoisted and the Indian National Anthem was sung. Dadra was declared the \"Free territory of Dadra\".\nOn the night of 28 July, around 30 to 35 volunteers of Azad Gomantak Dal proceeded to Naroli from Karambele (Karambeli) by swimming across the rivulets. June to September is the rainy season in the region, and the rivers are usually flooded during this season. The Daman Ganga river was flooded and no help could reach Naroli. This was the reason to choose this date for proceeding to Naroli. There were only six police personnel. The volunteers and the villagers reached the police station and asked them to surrender or face death. They immediately surrendered. The Portuguese rule of Naroli came to an end.\nThe Special Reserve Police in the Indian Territory did not intervene. J.D. Nagarwala, the Dy. Inspector General of the Special Reserve Police in the Indian Territory, without entering DNH, asked Captain Fidalgo, the Administrator of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, to surrender to the Indian Forces along with his paramilitary forces before they would be executed by the liberators.\nLeaving about 50 policemen and five civilian officers posted at Silvassa, Captain Fidalgo fled to Udva passing through Rakholi, Dappada, and Khanvel and surrendered to the SRP on 11 August. They were later allowed to go to Goa.\nIn the meanwhile, there were several rumours and the officers at Silvassa were in confusion. On 1 August, the liberators took advantage of the situation and proceeded from Dadra and Naroli and liberated Pipariya. The five police officers surrendered without resistance.\nDuring the night, the volunteers divided themselves into three batches and reached the police chowky at Silvassa.

Its population density is 698 square kilometres (269 sq mi). Though landlocked between Gujarat to the north and Maharashtra to the south, it is close to the western coast of India (between 20\u00b00\u2032 and 20\u00b025\u2032 N latitude and between 72\u00b050\u2032 and 73\u00b015\u2032 E longitude), and the Arabian Sea can be reached via Vapi in Gujarat.\nDadra and Nagar Haveli comprises two separate geographical units. The larger part\u2014Nagar Haveli\u2014spans a roughly C-shaped area upriver from the city of Daman on the coast, at the centre of which, straddling the border with Gujarat, is the Madhuban reservoir. The smaller enclave of Dadra is a short distance to the northwest.\nDadra and Nagar Haveli is in the middle of the undulating watershed of the Daman Ganga River, which flows through Nagar Haveli and later forms the short southern border of Dadra. The towns of Dadra and Silvassa lie on the north bank of the river.  The Western Ghats range rises to the east, and the foothills of the range occupy the eastern portion of the district.\nDadra and Nagar Haveli is surrounded by Valsad District of Gujarat on the west, north, and east, and by Thane District of Maharashtra on the south and southeast (after the division of Thane District, it is now surrounded by the newly formed Palghar District).Maghval is a small enclave village belonging to Gujarat that is located within Nagar Haveli, just south of Silvassa.The nearest railway station are Bhilad & Vapi in Gujarat on the Mumbai-Delhi route ( Western Railways ) . Bhilad is about 14 km west of Silvassa & Vapi is about 18 km northwest of Silvassa. Mumbai is approximately 180 km from Silvassa. Surat city is about 140 km away. Mumbai and Surat are the nearest airports.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nThe stretch of the main southern area is hilly terrain especially towards the northeast and east where it is surrounded by ranges of the Sahyadri mountains (Western Ghats). The central alluvial region of the land is almost plain and the soil is fertile and rich. The river Damanganga rises in the Ghat 64 km from the western coast and discharges itself in the Arabian Sea at the port of Daman after crossing Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

However, the reserved forest territory constitutes about 40% of the total geographical area. The protected forests constitute 2.45% of the total land area.\nAccording to satellite data taken in 2008, DNH has roughly about 114 square kilometres (28,000 acres) of moderately dense forest and 94 square kilometres (23,000 acres) open forest. According to the Forest Survey of India, DNH has two major forest types: tropical moist deciduous forest and tropical dry deciduous forest. The major produce is khair wood and general timber. Teak, sandra, khair, mahara and sisam are the major tree species in the region.\n Tree cover has been estimated around 27 km2 from the six-year data (2002\u201308), which is around 5.5% of the total geographical area of DNH.The Dadra and Nagar Haveli Wildlife Sanctuary covers 91.39 square kilometres, or about 19% of the union territory's total area. The sanctuary provides a habitat for leopard (Panthera pardus), wildcat (Felis silvestris), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), fox (Vulpes spp.), golden jackal (Canis aureus), nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus), four-horned antelope (Tetracerus quadricornis), sambar deer (Rusa unicolor), and chital deer (Axis axis), and birds including black drongo, bulbul, kingfisher, egret, hoopoe, mynah, heron, and red jungle fowl. In 2014 an additional eco-sensitive area was designated in the 100-meter buffer zone around the wildlife sanctuary, with an area of 26.57 square kilometres.The rich biodiversity makes it a habitat for a variety of birds and animals and thus a destination for inland and coastal safari and eco-tourism.

Being near the coast, all but the sparsely inhabited easternmost parts have a typical north Indian Ocean maritime climate. The summers are hot and become in their later part more humid with temperatures reaching as high as 39 \u00b0C in the month of May. The monsoon starts in the month of June and extends until September. The rainfall is brought by southwest monsoon winds. It is known as the Cherrapunji that covers the bulk of western India (apart from the Thar Desert) which produces most of the annual rainfall of 200\u2013250 cm.

The main food crops cultivated in this area are paddy (40% of the net sown area), ragi, small millets, jowar, sugarcanes, tur, nagli and val. Vegetables like tomato, cauliflower, cabbage and brinjal and fruits like mango, chikoo, guava, coconut and banana are also grown. Agriculture sector has given a major boost to the economy of DNH.\nThe local population is also involved in forestry and animal husbandry. 92.76% of the farmers belong to the weaker sections and 89.36% of them are tribal farmers. There is a full-fledged veterinary hospital and nine veterinary dispensaries. Mass vaccination against various diseases is done regularly free of cost by the Animal Husbandry Department.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\nAnother major contributor to the economy is the manufacturing industries. Due to heavy industrialisation in the region owing to tax sops for industries in the union territories, steady growth in employment has been observed. The employment generation is increasing at a pace of 5% per annum.\nIndustrialisation in the area began in 1965 when the first industrial unit in the UT was started at Piparia, Silvassa in the cooperative sector by Dan Udyog Sahakari Sangh Ltd, following which three industrial estates were established at Masat (1976), Khadoli (1982) and Silvassa (1985). Earlier (before 1965) only traditional craftsmen who made clay pots, leather items, viz., chappals, shoes and some other items of bamboo were present. Since there was no sales tax in the UT, it attracted many entrepreneurs. Around 30 new units comprising Engineering, fabric weaving units and dyeing and printing units were established until 1970.\nIn 1971, UT was declared as an industrially backward area by Government of India and increased the cash subsidy to 15 to 25% for the industrial units on their capital investment which resulted in the speedy industrial development. The scheme was however terminated from 30 September 1988. Sales Tax Act was implemented from January 1984 until 1998 under which industries enjoyed sales tax exemption for 15 years from the start-up date. VAT was introduced in 2005. At present, the newly established units get Central Sales Tax exemption which will continue until 2017.There are more than 2710 units functioning providing employment to about 46000 people with a capital investment of \u20b9377.8310 million (US$4.7 million).", "start_char_idx": 15551, "end_char_idx": 18782, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "778fd763-41fe-4ee4-be83-4305c004f348": {"__data__": {"id_": "778fd763-41fe-4ee4-be83-4305c004f348", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Dadar_and_Nagar_Haveli.txt", "file_name": "Dadar_and_Nagar_Haveli.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25362, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "388c5558-d566-4ed4-a76b-6fd38e8e18ba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Dadar_and_Nagar_Haveli.txt", "file_name": "Dadar_and_Nagar_Haveli.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25362, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "95e6087948b636a612a1c486cfb4f66481ccbc0e60c855f24ff4756116e6a828", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "406b9eeb-47cc-493c-951d-8113afd8dc7e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Dadar_and_Nagar_Haveli.txt", "file_name": "Dadar_and_Nagar_Haveli.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25362, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "8e89f61504d8a30d0757c7297fbfb1a486b9fc8bd80e5162f30f8cf4eb2b7243", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f7f5dc76-a757-4642-aa04-dedac4271dc2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "57872d72d54583a8ebe2974b5b2642d74f075dfdf252e17ba881eeeaf1381a6d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Demographics ==\nAccording to the 2011 census Dadra and Nagar Haveli has a population of 343,709. This gives it a ranking of 566th in India, out of a total of 640 districts. It has a population density of 698 inhabitants per square kilometre (1,810/sq mi), and its population growth rate over the decade from 2001 to 2011 was 55.5 percent, which is the highest percentage growth among all Indian states and union territories. Dadra and Nagar Haveli has a sex ratio of 775 females for every 1,000 males, and a literacy rate of 77.65%.\n\n\n=== Ethnography ===\nTribal groups make up a large part of the population viz 62%. The most prominent are Dhodia (16.90%), Kokna (16.85%) and Warli (62.94%), with small groups of Koli, Kathodi, Naika, and Dubla scattered across the territory, collectively representing 3.31% of the population. Dhodias and Dublas mainly populate the Northern part, whereas Koknas and Warlis are found all over the Union Territory. They worship the primary deities of Dis (Sun) and Chand (Moon), and Narandev, Kanasari, Himai, Hirva, Veer, Rangtai and Vagdev.\nOne prominent feature of this territory is that people from all over India form a part of non-tribal residents. DNH has many industries due to tax concessions granted to industry and therefore people from all over the country have migrated to the region.\nNorth Indians have a prime influence in the area. Gujarati is one of the three official languages, the others being Hindi and English. Besides Gujarati persons, one can find Marathi, Rajasthani, Bihari, Udia, Tamil, Uttar Pradeshi and people from several other states. The prime reason for such a diverse population is the industrial hub. Employment opportunities, good climate, and the landscape are highly appealing.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAs per the 2001 Census, out of the 137,225 ST persons of the UT, almost all were Hindus except for 3,796 Christians (2.8%). As a former Portuguese enclave, Silvassa has a significant Roman Catholic population. Kokna has the highest Christian population in 2001, 6.7%.

The Warlis speak an Indo-Aryan language related to Marathi and Konkani and are the largest tribal group in the territory and constitute ~ 63% (62.94%) of the total tribal population.\nRituals are extrely important to the Warlis; they are nature worshipers who regard the Sun and the Moon as the eyes of God. Their main deities are Naran dev, Hirwa, Himai, and Waghio, and stone images of these deities are found in tree groves.

The women wear traditional colourful sarees that are either knee-length or full length.Kathodia\nThe Kathodis, called Katkari in the Thane district of Maharashtra, make up 0.08% of the total tribal population of Dadra & Nagar Haveli. Their name is derived from their profession of kattha or catechew making.\nThey are considered to be at the bottom of the tribal social ladder. They usually live in forests, in semi-permanent settlements. Most of them cut wood and collect charcoal. The government has tried to improve their standard of living by engaging them in permanent professions.\nThey wear minimal jewelry; what is worn adorns the women only.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPortuguese Empire\nPortuguese India\nAnnexation of Goa\nGoa\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDistrict administration\nDistrict collector\n Dadra and Nagar Haveli travel guide from Wikivoyage", "start_char_idx": 22244, "end_char_idx": 25325, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c186ff1f-1fad-4376-b5ee-821c04409e7d": {"__data__": {"id_": "c186ff1f-1fad-4376-b5ee-821c04409e7d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Daman_and_Diu.txt", "file_name": "Daman_and_Diu.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5113, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8effee5e-f677-4431-91a6-262913406492", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Daman_and_Diu.txt", "file_name": "Daman_and_Diu.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5113, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "f8cf45654876ef8fc3c6690c140cdf430599589b9a3919653f128bdc592eeb50", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7e23f8c8-cddf-4736-a0d6-815c01308152", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Dadar_and_Nagar_Haveli.txt", "file_name": "Dadar_and_Nagar_Haveli.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25362, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "6817ca580b0d341352970f82e5073a4488e30321e9dec2d9b3d1143e330d94c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "20b45e80-ff60-4bda-b9e5-1b17c2e55aa3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c6373a1f7efb4d2b2b7fb51bd97d4c753673ad4c0ff2316dff53596eca69ee8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Daman and Diu (; ) was a union territory in northwestern India. With an area of 112 km2 (43 sq mi), it was the smallest administrative subdivision of India on the mainland. The territory comprised two districts, Daman and Diu island, geographically separated by the Gulf of Khambat. The state of Gujarat and the Arabian Sea bordered the territory. A Portuguese colony since the 1500s, the territories were taken by India with the Annexation of Goa in 1961. Daman and Diu were administered as part of the union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu between 1961 and 1987, after the Goa Opinion Poll they became a separate union territory. In 2019, legislation was passed to merge the union territory of Daman and Diu with its neighbouring union territory, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, to form the new union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu with effect from 26 January 2020.\n\n\n== History ==\nFor over 450 years, the coastal enclaves of Daman (Portuguese: Dam\u00e3o) and Diu on the Arabian Sea coast were part of Portuguese India, along with Goa and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Goa, Daman and Diu were incorporated into the Republic of India on 19 December 1961, by military conquest. Portugal did not recognise the Indian annexation of these territories until the Carnation Revolution of 1974. The territory has also been ruled by Kolis.The territory of Goa, Daman and Diu was administered as a single union territory until 30 May 1987, when Goa was granted statehood, leaving Daman and Diu as a separate union territory. Each enclave constituted one of the union territory's two districts. Daman and Diu are approximately 650 kilometres away from each other by road.\nOn 3 November 2019, Daman Collector Rakesh Minhas issued a Section 144 order banning peaceful assembly of four or more persons, slogan-shouting and the use of loudspeakers across the entire and ordered the conversion of Government High School, Bhimpore and the Government Sarvottam High School, Moti Daman into 'temporary jails'. This was in response to a land ownership dispute between the local indigenous fishing community and the local administration that had confiscated their land and bulldozed their homes. The ensuing 2019 Daman Indigenous Land Clearing Protests resulted with the detention of 70 protesters in the 'temporary jails' and another 8 arrests. Few of the adivasi fisherfolk were rehoused whilst most languished traumatised and homeless on the streets near the rubble of their razed homes.In December 2019, the Parliament of India passed legislation to merge Daman and Diu with the nearby union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli to create a new union territory to be known as Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the 2011 census, Daman and Diu had a literacy rate of 87.1%, higher than the national average of 74.04%. Male and female literacy rates are 91.5 and 79.5 per cent respectively. The lowest female-to-male ratio in India (618 females per thousand males) was recorded in Daman and Diu.

The Catholic Christians of Daman and Diu are pastorally served by the Metropolitan Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Goa and Daman, which has its see in Goa, the primatial see of India.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nGujarati was the mother tongue of most of the territory's population, as they belong to the Gujarati-speaking Damaniya sub-caste. Along with Gujarati, Hindi and English are also widely used. Daman and Diu were once part of a combined union territory along with Goa (a Konkani-speaking region) before Goa became a state in 1987.\nThe use of Portuguese, which was the territory's official language during the colonial period, is in decline and relegated to home use. It is also used as a liturgical language by the territory's Catholics. Standard Portuguese exists in a post-creole continuum while Daman and Diu Portuguese is spoken by about 10,000\u201312,000 people in Daman.\nThe languages taught in schools in Daman and Diu under the three-language formula were:\nFirst language: Gujarati\nSecond language: Hindi\nThird language: English\n\n\n== Administration ==\nAccording to the Constitution of India, the administration of Daman and Diu was carried out by an Administrator, appointed by the President of India as an agent of the President, not a head of state/government or a governor. He was assisted by several other officers in carrying out his duty.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nThe union territory of Daman and Diu had two districts:\n\nDiu District, an area of 40 km2 (15 sq mi). The main settlement is the town of Diu.\nDaman District, an area of 72 km2 (28 sq mi).

When applied to a function defined on a one-dimensional domain, it denotes the standard derivative of the function as defined in calculus. When applied to a field (a function defined on a multi-dimensional domain), it may denote any one of three operations depending on the way it is applied: the gradient or (locally) steepest slope of a scalar field (or sometimes of a vector field, as in the Navier\u2013Stokes equations); the divergence of a vector field; or the curl (rotation) of a vector field.\nDel is a very convenient mathematical notation for those three operations (gradient, divergence, and curl) that makes many equations easier to write and remember.  The del symbol (or nabla) can be formally defined as a vector operator whose components are the corresponding partial derivative operators. As a vector operator, it can act on scalar and vector fields in three different ways, giving rise to three different differential operations: first, it can act on scalar fields by a \"formal\" scalar multiplication\u2014to give a vector field called the gradient; second, it can act on vector fields by a \"formal\" dot product\u2014to give a scalar field called the divergence; and lastly, it can act on vector fields by a \"formal\" cross product\u2014to give a vector field called the curl. These \"formal\" products do not necessarily commute with other operators or products.

gives two more:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                div\n                \u2061\n                (\n                grad\n                \u2061\n

It was domesticated from the wild goat (C. aegagrus) of Southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. The goat is a member of the animal family Bovidae and the tribe Caprini, meaning it is closely related to the sheep. There are over 300 distinct breeds of goat. It is one of the oldest domesticated species of animal, according to archaeological evidence that its earliest domestication occurred in Iran at 10,000 calibrated calendar years ago.Goats have been used for milk, meat, fur, and skins across much of the world. Milk from goats is often turned into goat cheese.\nIn 2011, there were more than 924 million goats living in the world, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Modern English word goat comes from Old English g\u0101t \"she-goat, goat in general\", which in turn derives from Proto-Germanic *gaitaz (cf. Dutch/Frisian/Icelandic/Norwegian geit, German Gei\u00df, and Gothic gaits), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *\u01f5\u02b0aidos meaning \"young goat\" (cf. Latin haedus \"kid\"). To refer to the male goat, Old English used bucca (cf. Dutch/Frisian bok and giving modern buck) until ousted by hegote, hegoote in the late 12th century. Nanny goat (females) originated in the 18th century, and billy goat (for males) originated in the 19th century.Female goats are referred to as does or nannies, intact males are called bucks or billies, and juvenile goats of both sexes are called kids. Castrated males are called wethers. While the words hircine and caprine both refer to anything having a goat-like quality, hircine is used most often to emphasize the distinct smell of domestic goats.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nGoats are among the earliest animals domesticated by humans. The most recent genetic analysis confirms the archaeological evidence that the wild bezoar ibex of the Zagros Mountains is the likely original ancestor of probably all domestic goats today.\nNeolithic farmers began to herd wild goats primarily for easy access to milk and meat, as well as to their dung, which was used as fuel; and their bones, hair, and sinew were used for clothing, building, and tools. The earliest remnants of domesticated goats dating 10,000 years Before Present are found in Ganj Dareh in Iran. Goat remains have been found at archaeological sites in Jericho, Choga Mami, Djeitun, and \u00c7ay\u00f6n\u00fc, dating the domestication of goats in Western Asia at between 8,000 and 9,000 years ago.Studies of DNA evidence suggests 10,000 years ago as the domestication date.Historically, goat hide has been used for water and wine bottles in both traveling and transporting wine for sale. It has also been used to produce parchment.\n\n\n== Anatomy and health ==\nEach recognized breed of goat has specific weight ranges, which vary from over 140 kg (300 lb) for bucks of larger breeds such as the Boer, to 20 to 27 kg (45 to 60 lb) for smaller goat does. Within each breed, different strains or bloodlines may have different recognized sizes. At the bottom of the size range are miniature breeds such as the African Pygmy, which stand 41 to 58 cm (16 to 23 in) at the shoulder as adults.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3195, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "163d4d44-409b-4c04-883a-82a5a9b15ed0": {"__data__": {"id_": "163d4d44-409b-4c04-883a-82a5a9b15ed0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Goa.txt", "file_name": "Goa.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38537, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "00cfaf00-d0e1-42c2-b317-959fbb896b8d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Goa.txt", "file_name": "Goa.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38537, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "b1a4e9b8940d2aeebb6ec05d9d3d257c075e2997e70a93af228f47c46f12b36c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "655b6f25-c0f7-4659-bb7a-1b1ac5198fbc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Goa.txt", "file_name": "Goa.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38537, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "d7237095e10ef74dc2cc1bfdc5d3c301abf4fa090687b7c295bea173d246f2d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "55dc9212-c071-4d35-8aae-0e5f78a090fc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ef81843b78739a99c224cc81ad1f57e5ec1477fb0e4817e6867e12698bb9be3c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Horns ===\nMost goats naturally have two horns, of various shapes and sizes depending on the breed. There have been incidents of polycerate goats (having as many as eight horns), although this is a genetic rarity thought to be inherited. Unlike cattle, goats have not been successfully bred to be reliably polled, as the genes determining sex and those determining horns are closely linked. Breeding together two genetically polled goats results in a high number of intersex individuals among the offspring, which are typically sterile. Their horns are made of living bone surrounded by keratin and other proteins, and are used for defense, dominance, territoriality, and thermoregulation.\n\n\n=== Digestion and lactation ===\nGoats are ruminants. They have a four-chambered stomach consisting of the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum, and the abomasum. As with other mammal ruminants, they are even-toed ungulates. The females have an udder consisting of two teats, in contrast to cattle, which have four teats. An exception to this is the Boer goat, which sometimes may have up to eight teats.\n\n\n=== Eyes ===\nGoats have horizontal, slit-shaped pupils. Because goats' irises are usually pale, their contrasting pupils are much more noticeable than in animals such as cattle, deer, most horses, and many sheep, whose similarly horizontal pupils blend into a dark iris and sclera.\nGoats have no tear ducts.\n\n\n=== Beards ===\nBoth male and female goats may have beards, and many types of goat (most commonly dairy goats, dairy-cross Boers, and pygmy goats) may have wattles, one dangling from each side of the neck.\n\n\n=== Tan ===\nGoats expressing the tan pattern have coats pigmented completely with pheomelanin (tan/brown pigment). The allele which codes for this pattern is located at the agouti locus of the goat genome. It is completely dominant to all other alleles at this locus. There are multiple modifier genes which control how much tan pigment is actually expressed, so a tan-patterned goat can have a coat ranging from pure white to deep red.\n\n\n=== Genetics ===\nGoats are diploid and have 60 chromosomes.

The SLC11A1 gene is located on goat chromosome 2.\n\n\n== Reproduction ==\n\nGoats reach puberty between three and 15 months of age, depending on breed and nutritional status. Many breeders prefer to postpone breeding until the doe has reached 70% of the adult weight, but this separation is rarely possible in extensively managed, open-range herds.In temperate climates and among the Swiss breeds, the breeding season commences as the day length shortens, and ends in early spring or before. In equatorial regions, goats are able to breed at any time of the year. Successful breeding in these regions depends more on available forage than on day length. Does of any breed or region come into estrus (heat) every 21 days for two to 48 hours. A doe in heat typically flags (vigorously wags) her tail often, stays near the buck if one is present, becomes more vocal, and may also show a decrease in appetite and milk production for the duration of the heat.\n\nBucks (intact males) of Swiss and northern breeds come into rut in the fall as with the does' heat cycles. Bucks of equatorial breeds may show seasonal reduced fertility, but as with the does, are capable of breeding at all times. Rut is characterized by a decrease in appetite and obsessive interest in the does. A buck in rut will display flehmen lip curling and will urinate on his forelegs and face. Sebaceous scent glands at the base of the horns add to the male goat's odor, which is important to make him attractive to the female. Some does will not mate with a buck which has been descented.In addition to natural, traditional mating, artificial insemination has gained popularity among goat breeders, as it allows easy access to a wide variety of bloodlines.\n\nGestation length is approximately 150 days. Twins are the usual result, with single and triplet births also common. Less frequent are litters of quadruplet, quintuplet, and even sextuplet kids. Birthing, known as kidding, generally occurs uneventfully. Just before kidding, the doe will have a sunken area around the tail and hip, as well as heavy breathing. She may have a worried look, become restless and display great affection for her keeper. The mother often eats the placenta, which gives her much-needed nutrients, helps stanch her bleeding, and parallels the behavior of wild herbivores, such as deer, to reduce the lure of the birth scent for predators.Freshening (coming into milk production)  usually occurs at kidding, although milk production is also relatively common in unbred doelings of dairy breeds. Milk production varies with the breed, age, quality, and diet of the doe; dairy goats generally produce between 680 and 1,810 kg (1,500 and 4,000 lb) of milk per 305-day lactation. On average, a good quality dairy doe will give at least 3 kg (6 lb) of milk per day while she is in milk. A first-time milker may produce less, or as much as 7 kg (16 lb), or more of milk in exceptional cases. After the lactation, the doe will \"dry off\", typically after she has been bred. Occasionally, goats that have not been bred and are continuously milked will continue lactation beyond the typical 305 days. Meat, fiber, and pet breeds are not usually milked and simply produce enough for the kids until weaning.\nMale lactation is also known to occur in goats.", "start_char_idx": 5251, "end_char_idx": 8599, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aac8a2f8-9910-4233-9d8c-6be9d5e123fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "aac8a2f8-9910-4233-9d8c-6be9d5e123fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Goa.txt", "file_name": "Goa.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38537, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "00cfaf00-d0e1-42c2-b317-959fbb896b8d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Goa.txt", "file_name": "Goa.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38537, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "b1a4e9b8940d2aeebb6ec05d9d3d257c075e2997e70a93af228f47c46f12b36c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "55dc9212-c071-4d35-8aae-0e5f78a090fc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Goa.txt", "file_name": "Goa.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38537, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "76d6d675289e272e5b2fe963f96443ad38efccada4a550b1b5bba0fb4b921b00", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1d06d989-d406-4280-b3d9-57863c73fa87", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cfc36397fb8cb922ad6af9329da65e3229376af03a070c563a7e9391496e334", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Diet ==\nGoats are reputed to be willing to eat almost anything, including tin cans and cardboard boxes. While goats will not actually eat inedible material, they are browsing animals, not grazers like cattle and sheep, and (coupled with their highly curious nature) will chew on and taste just about anything remotely resembling plant matter to decide whether it is good to eat, including cardboard, clothing and paper (such as labels from tin cans).Aside from sampling many things, goats are quite particular in what they actually consume, preferring to browse on the tips of woody shrubs and trees, as well as the occasional broad-leaved plant. However, it can fairly be said that their plant diet is extremely varied, and includes some species which are otherwise toxic. They will seldom consume soiled food or contaminated water unless facing starvation. This is one reason goat-rearing is most often free-ranging, since stall-fed goat-rearing involves extensive upkeep and is seldom commercially viable.\nGoats prefer to browse on vines, such as kudzu, on shrubbery and on weeds, more like deer than sheep, preferring them to grasses. Nightshade is poisonous; wilted fruit tree leaves can also kill goats. Silage (fermented corn stalks) and haylage (fermented grass hay) can be used if consumed immediately after opening \u2013 goats are particularly sensitive to Listeria bacteria that can grow in fermented feeds. Alfalfa, a high-protein plant, is widely fed as hay; fescue is the least palatable and least nutritious hay. Mold in a goat's feed can make it sick and possibly kill it due to the presence of mycotoxins. Goats can contract Listeriosis, which is a life-threatening disease often caused by the ingestion of moldy hay. In various places in China, goats are used in the production of tea. Goats are released onto the tea terraces where they avoid consuming the green tea leaves (which contain bitter tasting substances), but instead eat the weeds. The goats' droppings fertilise the tea plants.The digestive physiology of a very young kid (like the young of other ruminants) is essentially the same as that of a monogastric animal. Milk digestion begins in the abomasum, the milk having bypassed the rumen via closure of the reticuloesophageal groove during suckling. At birth, the rumen is undeveloped, but as the kid begins to consume solid feed, the rumen soon increases in size and in its capacity to absorb nutrients.The adult size of a particular goat is a product of its breed (genetic potential) and its diet while growing (nutritional potential). As with all livestock, increased protein diets (10 to 14%) and sufficient calories during the prepuberty period yield higher growth rates and larger eventual size than lower protein rates and limited calories. Large-framed goats, with a greater skeletal size, reach mature weight at a later age (36 to 42 months) than small-framed goats (18 to 24 months) if both are fed to their full potential. Large-framed goats need more calories than small-framed goats for maintenance of daily functions.", "start_char_idx": 8602, "end_char_idx": 11665, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d06d989-d406-4280-b3d9-57863c73fa87": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d06d989-d406-4280-b3d9-57863c73fa87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Goa.txt", "file_name": "Goa.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38537, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "00cfaf00-d0e1-42c2-b317-959fbb896b8d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Goa.txt", "file_name": "Goa.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38537, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "b1a4e9b8940d2aeebb6ec05d9d3d257c075e2997e70a93af228f47c46f12b36c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "aac8a2f8-9910-4233-9d8c-6be9d5e123fd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Goa.txt", "file_name": "Goa.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38537, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9c5916eaa36db3d6082f0eab14239153a8ccb38b21c5d15e518f86abf059456d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8458958a-37b2-4890-b876-3cbadf3f0a6a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3c77335487863391583bc38bf0831f999968ea8d8b3942d80ff003e44c79968d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Behavior ==\nGoats are naturally curious. They are also agile and well known for their ability to climb and balance in precarious places. This makes them the only ruminant to regularly climb trees. Due to their agility and inquisitiveness, they are notorious for escaping their pens by testing fences and enclosures, either intentionally or simply because they are used to climbing. If any of the fencing can be overcome, goats will almost inevitably escape. Goats have been found to be as intelligent as dogs by some studies.\nWhen handled as a group, goats tend to display less herding behavior than sheep. When grazing undisturbed, they tend to spread across the field or range, rather than feed side by side as do sheep. When nursing young, goats will leave their kids separated (\"lying out\") rather than clumped, as do sheep. They will generally turn and face an intruder and bucks are more likely to charge or butt at humans than are rams.\nA study by Queen Mary University reports that goats try to communicate with people in the same manner as domesticated animals such as dogs and horses. Goats were first domesticated as livestock more than 10,000 years ago. Research conducted to test communication skills found that the goats will look to a human for assistance when faced with a challenge that had previously been mastered, but was then modified. Specifically, when presented with a box, the goat was able to remove the lid and retrieve a treat inside, but when the box was turned so the lid could not be removed, the goat would turn and gaze at the person and move toward them, before looking back toward the box. This is the same type of complex communication observed by animals bred as domestic pets, such as dogs. Researchers believe that better understanding of human-goat interaction could offer overall improvement in the animals' welfare. The field of anthrozoology has established that domesticated animals have the capacity for complex communication with humans when in 2015 a Japanese scientist determined that levels of oxytocin did increase in human subjects when dogs were exposed to a dose of the \"love hormone\", proving that a human-animal bond does exist. This is the same affinity that was proven with the London study above; goats are intelligent, capable of complex communication, and able to form bonds.\n\n\n== Diseases ==\n\nWhile goats are generally considered hardy animals and in many situations receive little medical care, they are subject to a number of diseases. Among the conditions affecting goats are respiratory diseases including pneumonia, foot rot, internal parasites, pregnancy toxicosis, and feed toxicity. Feed toxicity can vary based on breed and location. Certain foreign fruits and vegetables can be toxic to different breeds of goats.Goats can become infected with various viral and bacterial diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease, caprine arthritis encephalitis, caseous lymphadenitis, pinkeye, mastitis, and pseudorabies. They can transmit a number of zoonotic diseases to people, such as tuberculosis, brucellosis, Q fever, and rabies.\n\n\n== Life expectancy ==\nLife expectancy for goats is between 15 and 18 years. An instance of a goat reaching the age of 24 has been reported.Several factors can reduce this average expectancy; problems during kidding can lower a doe's expected life span to 10 or 11, and stresses of going into rut can lower a buck's expected life span to eight to 10 years.", "start_char_idx": 11668, "end_char_idx": 15120, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8458958a-37b2-4890-b876-3cbadf3f0a6a": {"__data__": {"id_": "8458958a-37b2-4890-b876-3cbadf3f0a6a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Goa.txt", "file_name": "Goa.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38537, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "00cfaf00-d0e1-42c2-b317-959fbb896b8d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Goa.txt", "file_name": "Goa.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38537, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "b1a4e9b8940d2aeebb6ec05d9d3d257c075e2997e70a93af228f47c46f12b36c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1d06d989-d406-4280-b3d9-57863c73fa87", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Goa.txt", "file_name": "Goa.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38537, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "cf73ea7cc5a3bf157ddd0002e26c44f85132f673f36efd5d5bed47276e11c661", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9c501cc8-e8cb-4b14-b03d-16979bb359df", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "45c89ca7ba29d9a783b8236acc45a31da701402e40f1f5622b0db91f01d9fe92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Agriculture ==\n\nA goat is useful to humans when it is living and when it is dead, first as a renewable provider of milk, manure, and fiber, and then as meat and hide.

The particular housing used for goats depends not only on the intended use of the goat, but also on the region of the world where they are raised. Historically, domestic goats were generally kept in herds that wandered on hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were frequently children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd. These methods of herding are still used today.\nIn some parts of the world, especially Europe and North America, distinct breeds of goats are kept for dairy (milk) and for meat production. Excess male kids of dairy breeds are typically slaughtered for meat. Both does and bucks of meat breeds may be slaughtered for meat, as well as older animals of any breed. The meat of older bucks (more than one year old) is generally considered not desirable for meat for human consumption. Castration at a young age prevents the development of typical buck odor.\n\nDairy goats are generally pastured in summer and may be stabled during the winter. As dairy does are milked daily, they are generally kept close to the milking shed. Their grazing is typically supplemented with hay and concentrates. Stabled goats may be kept in stalls similar to horses, or in larger group pens. In the US system, does are generally rebred annually. In some European commercial dairy systems, the does are bred only twice, and are milked continuously for several years after the second kidding.\nMeat goats are more frequently pastured year-round, and may be kept many miles from barns. Angora and other fiber breeds are also kept on pasture or range. Range-kept and pastured goats may be supplemented with hay or concentrates, most frequently during the winter or dry seasons.\nIn the Indian subcontinent and much of Asia, goats are kept largely for milk production, both in commercial and household settings. The goats in this area may be kept closely housed or may be allowed to range for fodder. The Salem Black goat is herded to pasture in fields and along roads during the day, but is kept penned at night for safe-keeping.In Africa and the Mideast, goats are typically run in flocks with sheep. This maximizes the production per acre, as goats and sheep prefer different food plants. Multiple types of goat-raising are found in Ethiopia, where four main types have been identified: pastured in annual crop systems, in perennial crop systems, with cattle, and in arid areas, under pastoral (nomadic) herding systems. In all four systems, however, goats were typically kept in extensive systems, with few purchased inputs. Household goats are traditionally kept in Nigeria. While many goats are allowed to wander the homestead or village, others are kept penned and fed in what is called a 'cut-and-carry' system. This type of husbandry is also used in parts of Latin America. Cut-and-carry, which refers to the practice of cutting down grasses, corn or cane for feed rather than allowing the animal access to the field, is particularly suited for types of feed, such as corn or cane, that are easily destroyed by trampling.Pet goats may be found in many parts of the world when a family keeps one or more animals for emotional reasons rather than as production animals.

However, some compare the taste of goat meat to veal or venison, depending on the age and condition of the goat. Its flavor is said to be primarily linked to the presence of 4-methyloctanoic and 4-methylnonanoic acid. It can be prepared in a variety of ways, including stewing, baking, grilling, barbecuing, canning, and frying; it can be minced, curried, or made into sausage. Due to its low fat content, the meat can toughen at high temperatures if cooked without additional moisture. One of the most popular goats grown for meat is the South African Boer, introduced into the United States in the early 1990s. The New Zealand Kiko is also considered a meat breed, as is the myotonic or \"fainting goat\", a breed originating in Tennessee.\n\n\n=== Milk, butter, and cheese ===\n\nGoats produce about 2% of the world's total annual milk supply. Some goats are bred specifically for milk. If the strong-smelling buck is not separated from the does, his scent will affect the milk.\nGoat milk naturally has small, well-emulsified fat globules, which means the cream remains suspended in the milk, instead of rising to the top, as in raw cow milk; therefore, it does not need to be homogenized. Indeed, if the milk is to be used to make cheese, homogenization is not recommended, as this changes the structure of the milk, affecting the culture's ability to coagulate the milk and the final quality and yield of cheese.Dairy goats in their prime (generally around the third or fourth lactation cycle) average\u20142.7 to 3.6 kg (6 to 8 lb)\u2014of milk production daily\u2014roughly 2.8 to 3.8 L (3 to 4 U.S. qt)\u2014during a ten-month lactation, producing more just after freshening and gradually dropping in production toward the end of their lactation. The milk generally averages 3.5% butterfat.Goat milk is commonly processed into cheese, butter, ice cream, yogurt, cajeta and other products. Goat cheese is known as fromage de ch\u00e8vre (\"goat cheese\") in France. Some varieties include Rocamadour and Montrachet. Goat butter is white because goats produce milk with the yellow beta-carotene converted to a colorless form of vitamin A. Goat milk has less cholesterol than cow's milk.", "start_char_idx": 19646, "end_char_idx": 22081, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ca8fb6a-6665-4c25-9935-2e372f34b3eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ca8fb6a-6665-4c25-9935-2e372f34b3eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Goa.txt", "file_name": "Goa.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38537, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "00cfaf00-d0e1-42c2-b317-959fbb896b8d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Goa.txt", "file_name": "Goa.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38537, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "b1a4e9b8940d2aeebb6ec05d9d3d257c075e2997e70a93af228f47c46f12b36c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "65e07721-a1b3-4883-8be1-57116399224b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Goa.txt", "file_name": "Goa.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38537, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "63736b903fe23b82871124978e7a01c165c531927de964240f84085ed0453ca0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "94948cb3-4bbe-48fe-a1f4-683925e56878", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b60e8fb9616f4cdd33cc768c2346ed6293b40c5ad7b9296ce4f801434f27b3ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "==== Nutrition ====\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics discourages feeding infants milk derived from goats. An April 2010 case report summarizes their recommendation and presents \"a comprehensive review of the consequences associated with this dangerous practice\", also stating, \"Many infants are exclusively fed unmodified goat's milk as a result of cultural beliefs as well as exposure to false online information. Anecdotal reports have described a host of morbidities associated with that practice, including severe electrolyte abnormalities, metabolic acidosis, megaloblastic anemia, allergic reactions including life-threatening anaphylactic shock, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and infections.\" Untreated caprine brucellosis results in a 2% case fatality rate. According to the USDA, doe milk is not recommended for human infants because it contains \"inadequate quantities of iron, folate, vitamins C and D, thiamine, niacin, vitamin B6, and pantothenic acid to meet an infant\u2019s nutritional needs\" and may cause harm to an infant's kidneys and could cause metabolic damage.The department of health in the United Kingdom has repeatedly released statements stating on various occasions that \"Goats' milk is not suitable for babies, and infant formulas and follow-on formulas based on goats' milk protein have not been approved for use in Europe\", and \"infant milks based on goats' milk protein are not suitable as a source of nutrition for infants.\" Moreover, according to the Canadian federal health department Health Canada, most of the dangers of, and counter-indications for, feeding unmodified goat's milk to infants parallel those associated with unmodified cow's milk\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially insofar as allergic reactions go.However, some farming groups promote the practice. For example, Small Farm Today, in 2005, claimed beneficial use in invalid and convalescent diets, proposing that glycerol ethers, possibly important in nutrition for nursing infants, are much higher in does' milk than in cows' milk. A 1970 book on animal breeding claimed that does' milk differs from cows' or humans' milk by having higher digestibility, distinct alkalinity, higher buffering capacity, and certain therapeutic values in human medicine and nutrition. George Mateljan suggested doe milk can replace ewe milk or cow milk in diets of those who are allergic to certain mammals' milk. However, like cow milk, doe milk has lactose (sugar), and may cause gastrointestinal problems for individuals with lactose intolerance. In fact, the level of lactose is similar to that of cow milk.Some researchers and companies producing goat's milk products have made claims that goat's milk is better for human health than most Western cow's milk due to it mostly lacking a form of \u03b2-casein proteins called A1, and instead mostly containing the A2 form, which does not metabolize to \u03b2-casomorphin 7 in the body.\nThese compositions vary by breed (especially in the Nigerian Dwarf breed), animal, and point in the lactation period.", "start_char_idx": 22084, "end_char_idx": 25085, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94948cb3-4bbe-48fe-a1f4-683925e56878": {"__data__": {"id_": "94948cb3-4bbe-48fe-a1f4-683925e56878", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Goa.txt", "file_name": "Goa.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38537, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "00cfaf00-d0e1-42c2-b317-959fbb896b8d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Goa.txt", "file_name": "Goa.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38537, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "b1a4e9b8940d2aeebb6ec05d9d3d257c075e2997e70a93af228f47c46f12b36c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1ca8fb6a-6665-4c25-9935-2e372f34b3eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Goa.txt", "file_name": "Goa.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38537, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "2ef31d2bee74bfb6c0f704dce28ec79bcd31d773aa04483ebdaf765287a9f0dc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9ada6c13-b86a-4247-9f52-d552d465cd1c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c7d213033cf1dcc20dbbe0f1ca05b10b29481ebf8efc3f81828b2b10c0c9fc82", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Fiber ===\nThe Angora breed of goats produces long, curling, lustrous locks of mohair. The entire body of the goat is covered with mohair and there are no guard hairs. The locks constantly grow to four inches or more in length. Angora crossbreeds, such as the pygora and the nigora, have been created to produce mohair and/or cashgora on a smaller, easier-to-manage animal.\nThe wool is shorn twice a year, with an average yield of about 4.5 kg (10 lb).\nMost goats have softer insulating hairs nearer the skin, and longer guard hairs on the surface. The desirable fiber for the textile industry is the former, and it goes by several names (down, cashmere and pashmina). The coarse guard hairs are of little value as they are too coarse, difficult to spin and difficult to dye. The cashmere goat produces a commercial quantity of cashmere wool, which is one of the most expensive natural fibers commercially produced; cashmere is very fine and soft. The cashmere goat fiber is harvested once a year, yielding around 260 g (9 oz) of down.\nIn South Asia, cashmere is called \"pashmina\" (from Persian pashmina, \"fine wool\").\nIn the 18th and early 19th centuries, Kashmir (then called Cashmere by the British), had a thriving industry producing shawls from goat-hair imported from Tibet and Tartary through Ladakh. The shawls were introduced into Western Europe when Napoleon Bonaparte, the General in Chief of the French campaign in Egypt (1798\u20131801), sent one to Paris. Since these shawls were produced in the upper Kashmir and Ladakh region, the wool came to be known as \"cashmere\".\n\n\n=== Land clearing ===\nGoats have been used by humans to clear unwanted vegetation for centuries. They have been described as \"eating machines\" and \"biological control agents\". There has been a resurgence of this in North America since 1990, when herds were used to clear dry brush from California hillsides thought to be endangered by potential wildfires. This form of using goats to clear land is sometimes known as conservation grazing. Since then, numerous public and private agencies have hired private herds from companies such as Rent A Goat to perform similar tasks. This may be expensive and their smell may be a nuisance. This practice has become popular in the Pacific Northwest, where they are used to remove invasive species not easily removed by humans, including (thorned) blackberry vines and poison oak. Chattanooga, TN and Spartanburg, SC have used goats to control kudzu, an invasive plant species prevalent in the southeastern United States.\n\n\n=== Medical training ===\nAs a goat's anatomy and physiology is not too dissimilar from that of humans, some countries' militaries use goats to train combat medics. In the United States, goats have become the main animal species used for this purpose after the Pentagon phased out using dogs for medical training in the 1980s. While modern mannequins used in medical training are quite efficient in simulating the behavior of a human body, trainees feel that \"the goat exercise provide[s] a sense of urgency that only real life trauma can provide\".

Goats are social animals and usually prefer the company of other goats, but because of their herd mentality, they will follow their owner and form close bonds with them, hence their continuing popularity.Goats are similar to deer with regard to nutrition and need a wide range of food, including things like hay, chaffhaye, grain feed or pelleted grain mix, and loose minerals. Goats generally either inherit certain feeding preferences or learn them after birth.\n\n\n== Breeds ==\n\nGoat breeds fall into overlapping, general categories. They are generally distributed in those used for dairy, fiber, meat, skins, and as companion animals. Some breeds are also particularly noted as pack goats.\n\n\n== Showing ==\nGoat breeders' clubs frequently hold shows, where goats are judged on traits relating to conformation, udder quality, evidence of high production, longevity, build and muscling (meat goats and pet goats) and fiber production and the fiber itself (fiber goats). People who show their goats usually keep registered stock and the offspring of award-winning animals command a higher price. Registered goats, in general, are usually higher-priced if for no other reason than that records have been kept proving their ancestry and the production and other data of their sires, dams, and other ancestors. A registered doe is usually less of a gamble than buying a doe at random (as at an auction or sale barn) because of these records and the reputation of the breeder.\nChildren's clubs such as 4-H also allow goats to be shown. Children's shows often include a showmanship class, where the cleanliness and presentation of both the animal and the exhibitor as well as the handler's ability and skill in handling the goat are scored. In a showmanship class, conformation is irrelevant since this is not what is being judged.\nVarious \"Dairy Goat Scorecards\" (milking does) are systems used for judging shows in the US. The American Dairy Goat Association (ADGA) scorecard for an adult doe includes a point system of a hundred total with major categories that include general appearance, the dairy character of a doe (physical traits that aid and increase milk production), body capacity, and specifically for the mammary system. Young stock and bucks are judged by different scorecards which place more emphasis on the other three categories; general appearance, body capacity, and dairy character.\nThe American Goat Society (AGS) has a similar, but not identical scorecard that is used in their shows. The miniature dairy goats may be judged by either of the two scorecards. The \"Angora Goat scorecard\" used by the Colored Angora Goat Breeder's Association (CAGBA), which covers the white and the colored goats, includes evaluation of an animal's fleece color, density, uniformity, fineness, and general body confirmation. Disqualifications include: a deformed mouth, broken down pasterns, deformed feet, crooked legs, abnormalities of testicles, missing testicles, more than 3 inch split in scrotum, and close-set or distorted horns.\n\n\n== Mythology and folklore ==\nArchaeologists excavating the ancient city of Ebla in Syria discovered, among others, the tomb of some king or great noble which included \na throne decorated with bronze goat heads. That led to this tomb becoming known as \"The Tomb of the Lord of the Goats\".According to Norse mythology, the god of thunder, Thor, has a chariot that is pulled by the goats Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj\u00f3str.

Yule Goat originally denoted the goat that was slaughtered around Yule, but it may also indicate a goat figure made out of straw. It is also used about the custom of going door-to-door singing carols and getting food and drinks in return, often fruit, cakes and sweets. \"Going Yule Goat\" is similar to the British custom wassailing, both with heathen roots. The G\u00e4vle Goat is a giant version of the Yule Goat, erected every year in the Swedish city of G\u00e4vle.\nThe Greek god Pan is said to have the upper body of a man and the horns and lower body of a goat. Pan was a very lustful god, nearly all of the myths involving him had to do with him chasing nymphs. He is also credited with creating the pan flute.\nThe goat is one of the 12-year cycle of animals which appear in the Chinese zodiac related to the Chinese calendar. Each animal is associated with certain personality traits; those born in a year of the goat are predicted to be shy, introverted, creative, and perfectionist.\n\nSeveral mythological hybrid creatures are believed to consist of parts of the goat, including the Chimera. The Capricorn sign in the Western zodiac is usually depicted as a goat with a fish's tail. Fauns and satyrs are mythological creatures that are part goat and part human. The mineral bromine is named from the Greek word \"br\u03ccmos\", which means \"stench of he-goats\".\nPopular Christian folk tradition in Europe associated Satan with imagery of goats. A common superstition in the Middle Ages was that goats whispered lewd sentences in the ears of the saints. The origin of this belief was probably the behavior of the buck in rut, the very epitome of lust. The common medieval depiction of the devil was that of a goat-like face with horns and small beard (a goatee). The Black Mass, a probably mythological \"Satanic mass\", involved Satan manifesting as a black goat for worship.\nThe goat has had a lingering connection with Satanism and pagan religions, even into modern times. The inverted pentagram, a symbol used in Satanism, is said to be shaped like a goat's head. The \"Baphomet of Mendes\" refers to a Satanic goat-like figure from 19th-century occultism.\n\nIn Finland the tradition of Nuutinp\u00e4iv\u00e4\u2014St. Knut's Day, January 13\u2014involves young men dressed as goats (Finnish: Nuuttipukki) who visit houses. Usually the dress was an inverted fur jacket, a leather or birch bark mask, and horns. Unlike the analogues Santa Claus, Nuuttipukki was a scary character (cf. Krampus). The men dressed as Nuuttipukki wandered from house to house, came in, and typically demanded food from the household and especially leftover alcoholic beverages.

However, nowadays the character is usually played by children and now involves a happy encounter.The common Russian surname Kozlov (Russian: \u041a\u043e\u0437\u043b\u043e\u0301\u0432), means \"goat\". Goatee refers to a style of facial hair incorporating hair on a man's chin, so named because of some similarity to a goat's facial feature.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nGoats are mentioned many times in the Bible. Their importance in ancient Israel is indicated by the seven different Hebrew and three Greek terms used in the Bible. A goat is considered a \"clean\" animal by Jewish dietary laws and a kid was slaughtered for an honored guest. It was also acceptable for some kinds of sacrifices. Goat-hair curtains were used in the tent that contained the tabernacle (Exodus 25:4). Its horns can be used instead of sheep's horn to make a shofar. On Yom Kippur, the festival of the Day of Atonement, two goats were chosen and lots were drawn for them. One was sacrificed and the other allowed to escape into the wilderness, symbolically carrying with it the sins of the community. From this comes the word \"scapegoat\". A leader or king was sometimes compared to a male goat leading the flock.In Matthew 25:31\u201346, Jesus said that like a shepherd he will separate the nations placing on his right hand the sheep, those who have shown kindness to needy and suffering disciples of Jesus and others. These he will reward, but the goats at his left hand, who failed to show kindness, will be punished. Although both sheep and goats were valued as livestock, this preference for sheep may relate to the importance of wool and the superior meat of adult sheep compared to the poor meat of adult goats.\n\n\n=== Satanism ===\n\nIn some depictions the devil is depicted, like Baphomet, as a goat, therefore the goat and goat's head is a significant symbol throughout Satanism. The inverted pentagram is the symbol used for Satanism, sometimes depicted with the goat's head of Baphomet within it, which originated from the Church of Satan. The goat's head and head of Baphomet is also used in the logo for The Satanic Temple, which also featured the inverted pentagram.\n\n\n== Feral goats ==\n\nGoats readily revert to the wild (become feral) if given the opportunity. The only domestic animal known to return to feral life as swiftly is the cat. Feral goats have established themselves in many areas: they occur in Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, the Galapagos and in many other places. When feral goats reach large populations in habitats which provide unlimited water supply and which do not contain sufficient large predators or which are otherwise vulnerable to goats' aggressive grazing habits, they may have serious effects, such as removing native scrub, trees and other vegetation which is required by a wide range of other creatures, not just other grazing or browsing animals. Feral goats are extremely common in Australia, with an estimated 2.6 million in the mid-1990s. However, in other circumstances where predator pressure is maintained, they may be accommodated into some balance in the local food web.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGoat tower\nSheep\u2013goat hybrid\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nBritish Goat Society\nGoat breeds from the Department of Animal Science, Oklahoma State University\nInternational Goat Association\nNorth American Packgoats Association\nThe American Dairy Goat Association", "start_char_idx": 34848, "end_char_idx": 38486, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b0f17cb-85f0-453d-b452-8e3fa18f4b01": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b0f17cb-85f0-453d-b452-8e3fa18f4b01", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Gujarat.txt", "file_name": "Gujarat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79848, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bff12e6c-0923-4619-a979-34ae6f7de089", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Gujarat.txt", "file_name": "Gujarat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79848, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "6b6b68544c22f454fa9e7e5bd2f3d0ded82d6101ec778797c7847abc02b4ded3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5ea33fbd-4c36-4a11-8481-08fce8f89cb4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Goa.txt", "file_name": "Goa.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38537, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "a858c68c933d135b095048145ddc52c7f464ecbc3b9e8f8a0db2dc835945bae4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2f4bf299-bd8b-4535-8519-1bd9adccfbdf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "41e27baa54f896cb143216614db6d5b2a5a8055541c8bc8f0a9909f95e425a7c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Gujarat ( GUUJ-\u0259-RAHT, Gujarati: [\u02c8\u0261ud\u0292\u0259\u027eat\u032a] ) is a state along the western coast of India. Its coastline of about 1,600 km (990 mi) is the longest in the country, most of which lies on the Kathiawar peninsula. Gujarat is the fifth-largest Indian state by area, covering some 196,024 km2 (75,685 sq mi); and the ninth-most populous state, with a population of 60.4 million in 2011. It is bordered by Rajasthan to the northeast, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu to the south, Maharashtra to the southeast, Madhya Pradesh to the east, and the Arabian Sea and the Pakistani province of Sindh to the west. Gujarat's capital city is Gandhinagar, while its largest city is Ahmedabad. The Gujaratis are indigenous to the state and their language, Gujarati, is the state's official language.\nThe state encompasses 23 sites of the ancient Indus Valley civilisation (more than any other state). The most important sites are Lothal (the world's first dry dock), Dholavira (the fifth largest site), and Gola Dhoro (where 5 uncommon seals were found). Lothal is believed to have been one of the world's first seaports. Gujarat's coastal cities, chiefly Bharuch and Khambhat, served as ports and trading centres in the Maurya and Gupta empires and during the succession of royal Saka dynasties in the Western Satraps era.\nAlong with Bihar, Mizoram and Nagaland, Gujarat is one of four Indian states to prohibit the sale of alcohol. The Gir Forest National Park in Gujarat is home to the only wild population of the Asiatic lion in the world.The economy of Gujarat is the fourth-largest in India, with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of \u20b916.55 trillion (equivalent to \u20b919 trillion or US$230 billion in 2023) and has the country's 10th-highest GSDP per capita of \u20b9215,000 (US$2,700). Gujarat has the highest exports of all states, accounting for around one-third of national exports. It ranks 21st among Indian states and union territories in human development index. Gujarat is regarded as one of the most industrialised states and has a low unemployment rate, \nbut the state ranks poorly on some social indicators and is at times affected by religious violence.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nGujarat is derived from the Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty, who ruled Gujarat in the 8th and 9th centuries CE. Parts of modern Rajasthan and Gujarat have been known as Gurjarat or Gurjarabhumi for centuries before the Mughal period.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient history ===\nGujarat was one of the main central areas of the Indus Valley civilisation, which is centred primarily in modern Pakistan. It contains ancient metropolitan cities from the Indus Valley such as Lothal, Dholavira and Gola Dhoro. The ancient city of Lothal was where India's first port was established. The ancient city of Dholavira is one of the largest and most prominent archaeological sites in India, belonging to the Indus Valley civilisation. The most recent discovery was Gola Dhoro. Altogether, about fifty Indus Valley settlement ruins have been discovered in Gujarat.\n\nThe ancient history of Gujarat was enriched by the commercial activities of its inhabitants.

There is clear historical evidence of trade and commerce ties with Egypt, Bahrain and Sumer in the Persian Gulf during the time period of 1000 to 750 BCE. There was a succession of various Indian empires such as the Mauryan dynasty, Western Satraps, Satavahana dynasty, Gupta Empire, Chalukya dynasty, Rashtrakuta Empire, Pala Empire and Gurjara-Pratihara Empire, as well as the Maitrakas and then the Chaulukyas.\nThe early history of Gujarat includes the imperial grandeur of Chandragupta Maurya who conquered a number of earlier states in what is now Gujarat. Pushyagupta, a Vaishya, was appointed the governor of Saurashtra by the Mauryan regime. He ruled Girinagar (modern-day Junagadh) (322 BCE to 294 BCE) and built a dam on the Sudarshan lake. Emperor Ashoka the Great, the grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, not only ordered his edicts engraved in the rock at Junagadh, but also asked Governor Tusherpha to cut canals from the lake where an earlier Indian governor had built a dam. Between the decline of Mauryan power and Saurashtra coming under the sway of the Samprati Mauryas of Ujjain, there was an Indo-Greek defeat in Gujarat of Demetrius. In 16th century manuscripts, there is an apocryphal story of a merchant of King Gondophares landing in Gujarat with Apostle Thomas. The incident of the cup-bearer torn apart by a lion might indicate that the port city described is in Gujarat.For nearly 300 years from the start of the 1st century CE, Saka rulers played a prominent part in Gujarat's history. The weather-beaten rock at Junagadh gives a glimpse of the ruler Rudradaman I (100 CE) of the Saka satraps known as Western Satraps, or Kshatraps. Mahakshatrap Rudradaman I founded the Kardamaka dynasty which ruled from Anupa on the banks of the Narmada up to the Aparanta region bordering Punjab. In Gujarat, several battles were fought between the Indian dynasties such as the Satavahana dynasty and the Western Satraps. The greatest and the mightiest ruler of the Satavahana dynasty was Gautamiputra Satakarni who defeated the Western Satraps and conquered some parts of Gujarat in the 2nd century CE.\nThe Kshatrapa dynasty was replaced by the Gupta Empire with the conquest of Gujarat by Chandragupta Vikramaditya. Vikramaditya's successor Skandagupta left an inscription (450 CE) on a rock at Junagadh which gives details of the governor's repairs to the embankment surrounding Sudarshan lake after it was damaged by floods. The Anarta and Saurashtra regions were both parts of the Gupta empire. Towards the middle of the 5th century, the Gupta empire went into decline. Senapati Bhatarka, the general of the Guptas, took advantage of the situation and in 470 set up what came to be known as the Maitraka state. He shifted his capital from Giringer to Valabhi, near Bhavnagar, on Saurashtra's east coast.", "start_char_idx": 2897, "end_char_idx": 5941, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0f6e4bb-26fb-44ac-920f-290f15433368": {"__data__": {"id_": "a0f6e4bb-26fb-44ac-920f-290f15433368", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Gujarat.txt", "file_name": "Gujarat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79848, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bff12e6c-0923-4619-a979-34ae6f7de089", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Gujarat.txt", "file_name": "Gujarat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79848, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "6b6b68544c22f454fa9e7e5bd2f3d0ded82d6101ec778797c7847abc02b4ded3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f4bf299-bd8b-4535-8519-1bd9adccfbdf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Gujarat.txt", "file_name": "Gujarat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79848, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "1737952ee3e00c4aeac0cb7ec6fdefd71fe5662edb83b08144730b3687ac806e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9c78874e-e3eb-4a40-9e8c-7576bdf0ed47", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "84e18f18e66830493fd9064314c54f6308eb0ee27c02af5e874501ecb57b7f54", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Senapati Bhatarka, the general of the Guptas, took advantage of the situation and in 470 set up what came to be known as the Maitraka state.

The Maitrakas of Vallabhi became very powerful with their rule prevailing over large parts of Gujarat and adjoining Malwa. A university was set up by the Maitrakas, which came to be known far and wide for its scholastic pursuits and was compared with the noted Nalanda University. It was during the rule of Dhruvasena Maitrak that Chinese philosopher-traveler Xuanzang/ I Tsing visited in 640 along the Silk Road.Gujarat was known to the ancient Greeks and was familiar with other Western centers of civilisation through the end of the European Middle Ages. The oldest written record of Gujarat's 2,000-year maritime history is documented in a Greek book titled The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea: Travel and Trade in the Indian Ocean by a Merchant of the First Century.\n\n\n=== Medieval history ===\nIn the early 8th century, the Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate established an empire in the name of the rising religion of Islam, which stretched from Spain in the west to Afghanistan and modern-day Pakistan in the east. Al-Junaid, the successor of Qasim, finally subdued the Hindu resistance within Sindh and established a secure base. The Arab rulers tried to expand their empire southeast, which culminated in the Caliphate campaigns in India fought in 730; they were defeated and expelled west of the Indus river, probably by a coalition of the Indian rulers Nagabhata I of the Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty, Vikramaditya II of the Chalukya dynasty and Bappa Rawal of the Guhila dynasty. After this victory, the Arab invaders were driven out of Gujarat. General Pulakeshin, a Chalukya prince of Lata, received the title Avanijanashraya (refuge of the people of the earth) and honorific of \"Repeller of the unrepellable\" by the Chalukya emperor Vikramaditya II for his victory at the battle at Navsari, where the Arab troops suffered a crushing defeat.In the late 8th century, the Kannauj Triangle period started. The three major Indian dynasties \u2013 the northwestern Indian Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty, the southern Indian Rashtrakuta dynasty and the eastern Indian Pala Empire \u2013 dominated India from the 8th to 10th centuries. During this period the northern part of Gujarat was ruled by the northern Indian Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty and the southern part of Gujarat was ruled by the southern Indian Rashtrakuta dynasty. However, the earliest epigraphical records of the Gurjars of Broach attest that the royal bloodline of the Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty of Dadda I, II and III (650\u2013750) ruled south Gujarat. Southern Gujarat was ruled by the Indian Rashtrakuta dynasty until it was captured by the Indian ruler Tailapa II of the Western Chalukya Empire.Zoroastrians from Greater Iran migrated to the western borders of India (Gujarat and Sindh) during the 8th or 10th century, to avoid persecution by Muslim invaders who were in the process of conquering Iran.", "start_char_idx": 5708, "end_char_idx": 8795, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c78874e-e3eb-4a40-9e8c-7576bdf0ed47": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c78874e-e3eb-4a40-9e8c-7576bdf0ed47", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Gujarat.txt", "file_name": "Gujarat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79848, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bff12e6c-0923-4619-a979-34ae6f7de089", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Gujarat.txt", "file_name": "Gujarat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79848, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "6b6b68544c22f454fa9e7e5bd2f3d0ded82d6101ec778797c7847abc02b4ded3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a0f6e4bb-26fb-44ac-920f-290f15433368", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Gujarat.txt", "file_name": "Gujarat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79848, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "e8943c6dd01bfb6ae0f931f3de18478f354f68f984ccb7a3a117146541a56ea1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b443d982-e430-4054-9585-f4bd3e6f109a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4f43c7c4ca81481bf653f388de2495793ae3d255bae988a0ba21577aac9c8592", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Southern Gujarat was ruled by the Indian Rashtrakuta dynasty until it was captured by the Indian ruler Tailapa II of the Western Chalukya Empire.Zoroastrians from Greater Iran migrated to the western borders of India (Gujarat and Sindh) during the 8th or 10th century, to avoid persecution by Muslim invaders who were in the process of conquering Iran. The descendants of those Zoroastrian refugees came to be known as the Parsi.Subsequently, L\u0101\u1e6da in southern Gujarat was ruled by the Rashtrakuta dynasty until it was captured by the Western Chalukya ruler Tailapa II.The Chaulukya dynasty ruled Gujarat from c. 960 to 1243. Gujarat was a major center of Indian Ocean trade, and their capital at Anhilwara (Patan) was one of the largest cities in India, with a population estimated at 100,000 in the year 1000. After 1243, the Solankis lost control of Gujarat to their feudatories, of whom the Vaghela chiefs of Dholka came to dominate Gujarat. In 1292 the Vaghelas became tributaries of the Yadava dynasty of Devagiri in the Deccan. Karandev of the Vaghela dynasty was the last Hindu ruler of Gujarat. He was defeated and overthrown by the superior forces of Alauddin Khalji from Delhi in 1297. With his defeat, Gujarat became part of the Delhi Sultanate, and the Rajput hold over Gujarat would never be restored.\nFragments of printed cotton from Gujarat have been discovered in Egypt, providing evidence for medieval trade in the western Indian Ocean. These fragments represent the Indian cotton traded in Egypt during the Fatimid, Ayyubid and Mamluk periods, from the tenth to sixteenth centuries. Similar cotton was also traded as far east as Indonesia.\n\n\n=== Muslim rule ===\n\n\n==== Islamic conquests, 1197\u20131614 ====\nAfter the Ghoris had assumed a position of Muslim supremacy over North India, Qutbuddin Aibak attempted to conquer Gujarat and annex it to his empire in 1197, but failed in his ambitions. An independent Muslim community continued to flourish in Gujarat for the next hundred years, championed by Arab merchants settling along the western coast. From 1297 to 1300, Alauddin Khalji, the Turko-Afghan Sultan of Delhi, destroyed the Hindu metropolis of Anhilwara and incorporated Gujarat into the Delhi Sultanate. After Timur sacked Delhi at the end of the 14th century, weakening the Sultanate, Gujarat's Muslim Khatri governor Zafar Khan Muzaffar (Muzaffar Shah I) asserted his independence, and his son, Sultan Ahmed Shah (ruled 1411\u20131442), established Ahmedabad as the capital.

Gujarat's relations with Egypt, which was then the premier Arab power in the Middle East, remained friendly over the next century and the Egyptian scholar, Badruddin-ad-Damamimi, spent several years in Gujarat in the shade of the Sultan before proceeding to the Bahmani Sultanate on the Deccan Plateau.Shah e Alam, a famous Sufi saint of the Chishti order who was the descendant of Makhdoom Jahaniyan Jahangasht from Bukhara, soon arrived in a group that included Arab theologian Ibn Suwaid, several Sayyid Sufi members of the Aydarus family of Tarim in Yemen, Iberian court interpreter Ali al-Andalusi from Granada, and the Arab jurist Bahraq from Hadramaut who was appointed a tutor of the prince. Among the illustrious names who arrived during the reign of Mahmud Begada was the philosopher Haibatullah Shah Mir from Shiraz, and the scholar intellectual Abu Fazl Ghazaruni from Persia who tutored and adopted Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, author of the Akbarnama. Later, a close alliance between the Ottoman Turks and Gujarati sultans to effectively safeguard Jeddah and the Red Sea trade from Portuguese imperialism, encouraged the existence of powerful Rumi elites within the kingdom who took the post of viziers in Gujarat keen to maintain ties with the Ottoman state.Humayun also briefly occupied the province in 1536, but fled due to the threat Bahadur Shah, the Gujarat king, imposed. The Sultanate of Gujarat remained independent until 1572, when the Mughal emperor Akbar conquered it and annexed it to the Mughal Empire.The Surat port (the only Indian port facing west) then became the principal port of India during Mughal rule, gaining widespread international repute. The city of Surat, famous for its exports of silk and diamonds, had reached a par with contemporary Venice and Beijing, great mercantile cities of Europe and Asia, and earned the distinguished title, Bab al-Makkah (Gate of Mecca).Drawn by the religious renaissance taking place under Akbar, Mohammed Ghaus moved to Gujarat and established spiritual centers for the Shattari Sufi order from Iran, founding the Ek Toda Mosque and producing such devotees as Wajihuddin Alvi of Ahmedabad whose many successors moved to Bijapur during the height of the Adil Shahi dynasty. At the same time, Zoroastrian high priest Azar Kayvan who was a native of Fars, immigrated to Gujarat founding the Zoroastrian school of illuminationists which attracted key Shi'ite Muslim admirers of the Safavid philosophical revival from Isfahan.\nEarly 14th-century Maghrebi adventurer, Ibn Batuta, who famously visited India with his entourage, recalls in his memoirs about Cambay, one of the great emporia of the Indian Ocean that indeed:\n\n Cambay is one of the most beautiful cities as regards the artistic architecture of its houses and the construction of its mosques.

But others were men with Arab or Persian patronyms whose families had settled in the town generations, even centuries earlier, intermarrying with Gujarati women, and assimilating everyday customs of the Hindu hinterland.The Age of Discovery heralded the dawn of pioneer Portuguese and Spanish long-distance travel in search of alternative trade routes to \"the East Indies\", moved by the trade of gold, silver and spices. In 1497, Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama is said to have discovered the Europe-to-India sea route which changed the course of history, thanks to Kutchi sailor Kanji Malam, who showed him the route from the East African coasts of Mozambique sailing onwards to Calicut off the Malabar coast in India. Later, the Gujarat Sultanate allied with the Ottomans and Egyptian Mamluks naval fleets led by governor-generals Malik Ayyaz and Amir Husain Al-Kurdi, vanquished the Portuguese in the 1508 Battle of Chaul resulting in the first Portuguese defeat at sea in the Indian Ocean.To 16th-century European observers, Gujarat was a fabulously wealthy country. The customs revenue of Gujarat alone in the early 1570s was nearly three times the total revenue of the whole Portuguese empire in Asia in 1586\u201387, when it was at its height. Indeed, when the British arrived on the coast of Gujarat, houses in Surat already had windows of Venetian glass imported from Constantinople through the Ottoman empire. In 1514, the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa described the cosmopolitan atmosphere of Rander known otherwise as City of Mosques in Surat province, which gained the fame and reputation of illustrious Islamic scholars, Sufi-saints, merchants and intellectuals from all over the world:\n Ranel (Rander) is a good town of the Moors, built of very pretty houses and squares. It is a rich and agreeable place ... the Moors of the town trade with Malacca, Bengal, Tawasery (Tannasserim), Pegu, Martaban, and Sumatra in all sort of spices, drugs, silks, musk, benzoin and porcelain. They possess very large and fine ships and those who wish Chinese articles will find them there very completely. The Moors of this place are white and well dressed and very rich they have pretty wives, and in the furniture of these houses have china vases of many kinds, kept in glass cupboards well arranged. Their women are not secluded like other Moors, but go about the city in the day time, attending to their business with their faces uncovered as in other parts.\nThe conquest of the Kingdom of Gujarat marked a significant event of Akbar's reign. Being the major trade gateway and departure harbour of pilgrim ships to Mecca, it gave the Mughal Empire free access to the Arabian sea and control over the rich commerce that passed through its ports.

Gujaratis, including Hindus and Muslims as well as the enterprising Parsi class of Zoroastrians, had been specialising in the organisation of overseas trade for many centuries, and had moved into various branches of commerce such as commodity trade, brokerage, money-changing, money-lending and banking.By the 17th century, Chavuse and Baghdadi Jews had assimilated into the social world of the Surat province, later on their descendants would give rise to the Sassoons of Bombay and the Ezras of Calcutta, and other influential Indian-Jewish figures who went on to play a philanthropical role in the commercial development of 19th-century British Crown Colony of Shanghai. Spearheaded by Khoja, Bohra, Bhatiya shahbandars and Moorish nakhudas who dominated sea navigation and shipping, Gujarat's transactions with the outside world had created the legacy of an international transoceanic empire which had a vast commercial network of permanent agents stationed at all the great port cities across the Indian Ocean. These networks extended to the Philippines in the east, East Africa in the west, and via maritime and the inland caravan route to Russia in the north.Tom\u00e9 Pires, a Portuguese official at Malacca, wrote of conditions during the reigns of Mahmud I and Mozaffar II:\n\n\"Cambay stretches out two arms; with her right arm she reaches toward Aden and with the other towards Malacca\"\nHe also described Gujarat's active trade with Goa, the Deccan Plateau and the Malabar. His contemporary, Duarte Barbosa, describing Gujarat's maritime trade, recorded the import of horses from the Middle East and elephants from Malabar, and lists exports which included muslins, chintzes and silks, carnelian, ginger and other spices, aromatics, opium, indigo and other substances for dyeing, cereals and legumes. Persia was the destination for many of these commodities, and they were partly paid for in horses and pearls taken from Hormuz. The latter item, in particular, led Sultan Sikandar Lodi of Delhi, according to Ali-Muhammad Khan, author of the Mirat-i-Ahmadi, to complain that the\n\nsupport of the throne of Delhi is wheat and barley but the foundation of the realm of Gujarat is coral and pearls\nHence, the sultans of Gujarat possessed ample means to sustain lavish patronage of religion and the arts, to build madrasas and \u1e35\u0101naq\u0101hs, and to provide douceurs for the literati, mainly poets and historians, whose presence and praise enhanced the fame of the dynasty.\nEven at the time of Tom\u00e9 Pires' travel to the East Indies in the early 16th century, Gujarati merchants had earned an international reputation for their commercial acumen and this encouraged the visit of merchants from Cairo, Armenia, Abyssinia, Khorasan, Shiraz, Turkestan and Guilans from Aden and Hormuz. Pires noted in his Suma Orientale:\n These [people] are [like] Italians in their knowledge of and dealings in merchandise ... they are men who understand merchandise; they are so properly steeped in the sound and harmony of it, that the Gujaratees say that any offence connected with merchandise is pardonable. There are Gujaratees settled everywhere. They work some for some and others for others. They are diligent, quick men in trade.

He was the third son and sixth child of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal. At the time of his birth, his father, Shah Jahan, was then the Subahdar (governor) of Gujarat, and his grandfather, Jehangir, was the Mughal Emperor. Before he became emperor, Aurangzeb was made Subahdar of Gujarat subah as part of his training and was stationed at Ahmedabad.Aurangzeb had great love for his place of birth. In 1704, he wrote a letter to his eldest son, Muhammad Azam Shah, asking him to be kind and considerate to the people of Dahod as it was his birthplace. Muhammad Azam was then the Subedar (governor) of Gujarat.In his letter, Aurangzeb wrote:\n My son of exalted rank, the town of Dahod, one of the dependencies of Gujarat, is the birthplace of this sinner. Please consider a regard for the inhabitants of that town as incumbent on you.\n\n\n=== Maratha Empire ===\nWhen the cracks had started to develop in the edifice of the Mughal Empire in the mid-17th century, the Marathas were consolidating their power in the west, Chatrapati Shivaji, the great Maratha ruler, attacked Surat in southern Gujarat twice first in 1664 and again in 1672. These attacks marked the entry of the Marathas into Gujarat. However, before the Maratha had made inroads into Gujarat, the Europeans had made their presence felt, led by the Portuguese, and followed by the Dutch and the English.\nThe Peshwas had established sovereignty over parts of Gujarat and collected taxes and tributes through their representatives. Damaji Rao Gaekwad and Kadam Bande divided the Peshwa territory between them, with Damaji establishing the sway of Gaekwad over Gujarat and making Baroda (present day Vadodara in southern Gujarat) his capital. The ensuing internecine war among the Marathas was fully exploited by the British, who interfered in the affairs of both Gaekwads and the Peshwas.\nIn Saurashtra, as elsewhere, the Marathas were met with resistance. The decline of the Mughal Empire helped form larger peripheral states in Saurashtra, including Junagadh, Jamnagar, Bhavnagar and a few others, which largely resisted the Maratha incursions.", "start_char_idx": 20608, "end_char_idx": 23031, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56f11f97-52d0-4843-b467-f3e7b4ff3483": {"__data__": {"id_": "56f11f97-52d0-4843-b467-f3e7b4ff3483", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Gujarat.txt", "file_name": "Gujarat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79848, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bff12e6c-0923-4619-a979-34ae6f7de089", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Gujarat.txt", "file_name": "Gujarat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79848, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "6b6b68544c22f454fa9e7e5bd2f3d0ded82d6101ec778797c7847abc02b4ded3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "09f3d73c-ac9f-4718-9f25-529a5c152ee0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Gujarat.txt", "file_name": "Gujarat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79848, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "ce5aa573383325e135d5f235e1d941deca8e354b8ea0b218da690bd8c911b310", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "af02eb7e-a572-4b17-b7ed-a5530a9450da", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b1ba9017e99e0bae36be471c4a76a0df641f65a7a46795ca1f250f840d822a3e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== European colonialism, 1614\u20131947 ===\nIn the 1600s, the Dutch, French, English and Portuguese all established bases along the western coast of the region. Portugal was the first European power to arrive in Gujarat, and after the Battle of Diu, acquired several enclaves along the Gujarati coast, including Daman and Diu as well as Dadra and Nagar Haveli. These enclaves were administered by Portuguese India under a single union territory for over 450 years, only to be later incorporated into the Republic of India on 19 December 1961 by military conquest.\nThe British East India Company established a factory in Surat in 1614 following the commercial treaty made with Mughal Emperor Nuruddin Salim Jahangir, which formed their first base in India, but it was eclipsed by Bombay after the English received it from Portugal in 1668 as part of the marriage treaty of Charles II of England and Catherine of Braganza, daughter of King John IV of Portugal. The state was an early point of contact with the west, and the first British commercial outpost in India was in Gujarat.17th-century French explorer Fran\u00e7ois Pyrard de Laval, who is remembered for his 10-year sojourn in South Asia, bears witness in his account that the Gujaratis were always prepared to learn workmanship from the Portuguese, and in turn imparted skills to the Portuguese:\n I have never seen men of wit so fine and polished as are these Indians: they have nothing barbarous or savage about them, as we are apt to suppose. They are unwilling indeed to adopt the manners and customs of the Portuguese; yet do they regularly learn their manufactures and workmanship, being all very curious and desirous of learning. In fact, the Portuguese take and learn more from them than they from the Portuguese.\nLater in the 17th century, Gujarat came under control of the Hindu Maratha Empire that arose, defeating the Muslim Mughals who had dominated the politics of India. Most notably, from 1705 to 1716, Senapati Khanderao Dabhade led the Maratha Empire forces in Baroda. Pilaji Gaekwad, first ruler of Gaekwad dynasty, established the control over Baroda and other parts of Gujarat.\nThe British East India Company wrested control of much of Gujarat from the Marathas during the Second Anglo-Maratha War in 1802\u20131803. Many local rulers, notably the Maratha Gaekwad Maharajas of Baroda (Vadodara), made a separate peace with the British and acknowledged British sovereignty in return for retaining local self-rule.\nAn epidemic outbreak in 1812 killed half the population of Gujarat.Gujarat was placed under the political authority of the Bombay Presidency, with the exception of Baroda State, which had a direct relationship with the Governor-General of India. From 1818 to 1947, most of present-day Gujarat, including Kathiawar, Kutch and northern and eastern Gujarat were divided into hundreds of princely states, but several districts in central and southern Gujarat, namely Ahmedabad, Broach (Bharuch), Kaira (Kheda), Panchmahal and Surat, were governed directly by British officials.

This was resolved in 1947 with a plebiscite for full union with India following the next year.After Indian independence and the partition of India in 1947, the new Indian government grouped the former princely states of Gujarat into three larger units; Saurashtra, which included the former princely states on the Kathiawad peninsula, Kutch, and Bombay state, which included the former British districts of Bombay Presidency together with most of Baroda State and the other former princely states of eastern Gujarat. Bombay state was enlarged to include Kutch, Saurashtra (Kathiawar) and parts of Hyderabad state and Madhya Pradesh in central India. The new state had a mostly Gujarati-speaking north and a Marathi-speaking south. Agitation by Gujarati nationalists, the Mahagujarat Movement, and Marathi nationalists, the Samyukta Maharashtra, for their own states led to the split of Bombay state on linguistic lines; on 1 May 1960, it became the new states of Gujarat and Maharashtra. In 1969 riots, at least 660 died and properties worth millions were destroyed.The first capital of Gujarat was Ahmedabad. The capital of Gujarat was moved to Gandhinagar in 1970. Nav Nirman Andolan was a socio-political movement of 1974. It was a students' and middle class people's movement against economic crisis and corruption in public life. This was the first and last successful agitation after the Independence of India that ousted an elected government.Gujarat has emerged as an important industrial hub in India. In Western India Surat was among the strongest industrial clusters in the 1970s. Between 1971 and 1981 diamond cutting was established as industry in Surat. At the same time the production of artificial silk and a substantial petrochemical industry became a fixture in Surat.The Morvi dam failure, in 1979, resulted in the death of thousands of people and large economic loss. In the 1980s, a reservation policy was introduced in the country, which led to anti-reservation protests in 1981 and 1985. The protests witnessed violent clashes between people belonging to various castes.The 2001 Gujarat earthquake was located about 9 km south-southwest of the village of Chobari in the Bhachau taluka of Kutch District. This magnitude 7.7 shock killed around 20,000 people (including at least 18 in South-eastern Pakistan), injured another 167,000 and destroyed nearly 400,000 homes.In February 2002, the Godhra train burning led to statewide riots, resulting in the deaths of 1044 people \u2013 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus, and hundreds missing still unaccounted for. Akshardham Temple was attacked by two terrorists in September 2002, killing 32 people and injuring more than 80 others. National Security Guards intervened to end the siege killing both terrorists.

The administration of the state is led by the Chief Minister.\n\nAfter the independence of India in 1947, the Indian National Congress (INC) ruled the Bombay State (which included present-day Gujarat and Maharashtra). Congress continued to govern Gujarat after the state's creation in 1960.\nDuring and after India's State of Emergency of 1975\u20131977, public support for the INC eroded, but it continued to hold government until 1995 with the brief rule of nine months by Janata Morcha. In the 1995 Assembly elections, the Congress lost to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Keshubhai Patel who became the Chief Minister. His government lasted only two years. The fall of that government was provoked by a split in the BJP led by Shankersinh Vaghela. BJP again won election in 1998 with clear majority. In 2001, following the loss of two assembly seats in by-elections, Keshubhai Patel resigned and yielded power to Narendra Modi. BJP retained a majority in the 2002 election, and Narendra Modi remained as Chief Minister. On 1 June 2007, Narendra Modi became the longest serving Chief Minister of Gujarat. BJP retained the power in subsequent elections in 2007 and 2012 and Narendra Modi continued as the chief minister. After Narendra Modi became the prime minister of India in 2014, Anandiben Patel became the first female chief minister of the state. Vijay Rupani took over as chief minister and Nitin Patel as deputy chief minister on 7 August 2016 after Anandiben Patel resigned earlier on 3 August. Bhupendrabhai Patel became chief minister in September 2021 after the resignation of Vijay Rupani.\nThe incumbent chief secretary of Gujarat is Raj Kumar and director general of police (DGP) is Vikas Sahay.", "start_char_idx": 36246, "end_char_idx": 39086, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2fe677c5-d641-413b-bbf5-57f094c6885e": {"__data__": {"id_": "2fe677c5-d641-413b-bbf5-57f094c6885e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Gujarat.txt", "file_name": "Gujarat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79848, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bff12e6c-0923-4619-a979-34ae6f7de089", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Gujarat.txt", "file_name": "Gujarat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79848, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "6b6b68544c22f454fa9e7e5bd2f3d0ded82d6101ec778797c7847abc02b4ded3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6fb32be3-70c5-4c4f-a84c-ff466f08d4f9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Gujarat.txt", "file_name": "Gujarat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79848, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "0bad3141ded5e386902304f5441103de2dc092523f5c8a8080309fec08d21ad0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a05dcb40-d48d-4a4a-b930-8fb51e1498be", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2dbae4ceed7f8702c8dbefb4fc48270887f7496fe3013e5c080c7fbcefe58f87", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Economy ==\n\nDuring the British Raj, Gujarati businesses played a major role in enriching the economies of Karachi and Mumbai.

In 2010, Forbes' list of the world's fastest growing cities included Ahmedabad at number 3 after Chengdu and Chongqing from China. The state is rich in calcite, gypsum, manganese, lignite, bauxite, limestone, agate, feldspar, and quartz sand, and successful mining of these minerals is done in their specified areas. Jamnagar is the hub for manufacturing brass parts. Gujarat produces about 98% of India's required amount of soda ash, and gives the country about 78% of the national requirement of salt. It is one of India's most prosperous states, having a per-capita GDP significantly above India's average. Kalol, Khambhat, and Ankleshwar are today known for their oil and natural gas production. Dhuvaran has a thermal power station, which uses coal, oil, and gas. Also, on the Gulf of Khambhat, 50 km (31 mi) southeast of Bhavnagar, is the Alang Ship Recycling Yard (the world's largest). MG Motor India manufactures its cars at Halol near Vadodara, Tata Motors manufactures the Tata Nano from Sanand near Ahmedabad, and AMW trucks are made near Bhuj. Surat, a city by the Gulf of Khambhat, is a hub of the global diamond trade. In 2003, 92% of the world's diamonds were cut and polished in Surat. The diamond industry employs 500,000 people in Gujarat.At an investor's summit entitled \"Vibrant Gujarat Global Investor Summit\", arranged between 11 and 13 January 2015, at Mahatma Mandir, Gandhinagar, the state government signed 21000 Memoranda of Understanding for Special Economic Zones worth a total of \u20b9 2.5 million crores (short scale). However, most of the investment was from domestic industry. In the fourth Vibrant Gujarat Global Investors' Summit held at Science City, Ahmedabad, in January 2009, there were 600 foreign delegates.

The rest 559 MW is nuclear power generation capacity. The renewable energy installed capacity includes 9,209 MW wind power and 7,180 MW solar power, as of March 2022.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nThe total geographical area of Gujarat is 19,602,400 hectares, of which crops take up 10,630,700 hectares. The three main sources of growth in Gujarat's agriculture are from cotton production, the rapid growth of high-value foods such as livestock, fruits and vegetables, and from wheat production, which saw an annual average growth rate of 28% between 2000 and 2008 (According to the International Food Policy Research Institute). Other major produce includes bajra, groundnut, cotton, rice, maize, wheat, mustard, sesame, pigeon pea, green gram, sugarcane, mango, banana, sapota, lime, guava, tomato, potato, onion, cumin, garlic, isabgul and fennel. Whilst, in recent times, Gujarat has seen a high average annual growth of 9% in the agricultural sector, the rest of India has an annual growth rate of around 3%. This success was lauded by former President of India, APJ Abdul Kalam.The strengths of Gujarat's agricultural success have been attributed to diversified crops and cropping patters; climatic diversity (8 climatic zones for agriculture); the existence of 4 agricultural universities in the state, which promote research in agricultural efficiency and sustainability; co-operatives; adoption of hi-tech agriculture such as tissue culture, green houses and shed-net houses; agriculture export zones; strong marketing infrastructure, which includes cold storage, processing units, logistic hubs and consultancy facilities.Gujarat is the main producer of tobacco, cotton, and groundnuts in India. Other major food crops produced are rice, wheat, jowar, bajra, maize, tur, and gram. The state has an agricultural economy; the total crop area amounts to more than one-half of the total land area.Animal husbandry and dairying have played vital roles in the rural economy of Gujarat. Dairy farming, primarily concerned with milk production, functions on a co-operative basis and has more than a million members. Gujarat is the largest producer of milk in India. The Amul milk co-operative federation is well known all over India, and it is Asia's biggest dairy. Among the livestock raised are, buffaloes and other cattle, sheep, and goats. As per the results of livestock census 1997, there were 20.97 million head of livestock in Gujarat State. In the estimates of the survey of major livestock products, during the year 2002\u201303, Gujarat produced 6.09 million tonnes of milk, 385 million eggs and 2.71 million kg of wool. Gujarat also contributes inputs to the textiles, oil, and soap industries.\nThe adoption of cooperatives in Gujarat is widely attributed to much of the success in the agricultural sector, particularly sugar and dairy cooperatives. Cooperative farming has been a component of India's strategy for agricultural development since 1951. Whilst the success of these was mixed throughout the country, their positive impact on the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat have been the most significant. In 1995 alone, the two states had more registered co-operatives than any other region in the country.

In 1995 alone, the two states had more registered co-operatives than any other region in the country. Out of these, the agricultural cooperatives have received much attention. Many have focused on subsidies and credit to farmers and rather than collective gathering, they have focused on facilitating collective processing and marketing of produce. However, whilst they have led to increased productivity, their effect on equity in the region has been questioned, because membership in agricultural co-operatives has tended to favour landowners whilst limiting the entry of landless agricultural labourers. An example of co-operative success in Gujarat can be illustrated through dairy co-operatives, with the particular example of Amul (Anand Milk Union Limited).\n\nAmul was formed as a dairy cooperative in 1946, in the city of Anand, Gujarat. The cooperative, Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd.\n(GCMMF), is jointly owned by around 2.6 million milk producers in Gujarat. Amul has been seen as one of the best examples of cooperative achievement and success in a developing economy and the Amul pattern of growth has been taken as a model for rural development, particularly in the agricultural sector of developing economies. The company stirred the White Revolution of India (also known as Operation Flood), the world's biggest dairy development program, and made the milk-deficient nation of India the largest milk producer in the world, in 2010. The \"Amul Model\" aims to stop the exploitation by middlemen and encourage freedom of movement since the farmers are in control of procurement, processing and packaging of the milk and milk products. The company is worth 2.5 billion US dollars (as of 2012).70% of Gujarat's area is classified as semi-arid to arid climatically, thus the demand on water from various economic activities puts a strain on the supply. Of the total gross irrigated area, 16\u201317% is irrigated by government-owned canals and 83\u201384% by privately owned tube wells and other wells extracting groundwater, which is the predominant source of irrigation and water supply to the agricultural areas. As a result, Gujarat has faced problems with groundwater depletion, especially after demand for water increased in the 1960s. As access to electricity in rural areas increased, submersible electric pumps became more popular in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the Gujarat Electricity Board switched to flat tariff rates linked to the horsepower of pumps, which increased tubewell irrigation again and decreased the use of electric pumps. By the 1990s, groundwater abstraction rates exceeded groundwater recharge rate in many districts, whilst only 37.5% of all districts has \"safe\" recharge rates. Groundwater maintenance and preventing unnecessary loss of the available water supplies is now an issue faced by the state. The Sardar Sarovar Project, a debated dam project in the Narmada valley consisting of a network of canals, has significantly increased irrigation in the region. However, its impact on communities who were displaced is still a contested issue. In 2012 Gujarat began an experiment to reduce water loss due to evaporation in canals and to increase sustainability in the area, by constructing solar panels over the canals. In a one megawatt (MW) solar power project set up at Chandrasan, Gujarat uses solar panels fixed over a 750-metre stretch of an irrigation canal.

The Chandrasan project is projected to save 9 million litres of water per year.The Government of Gujarat, to improve soil management and introduce farmers to new technology, started on a project which involved giving every farmer a Soil Health Card. This acts like a ration card, providing permanent identification for the status of cultivated land, as well as farmers' names, account numbers, survey numbers, soil fertility status and general fertiliser dose. Samples of land from each village are taken and analysed by the Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertiliser Corporation, State Fertiliser Corporation and Indian Farmers Fertilisers Co-operative. 1,200,000 soil test data from the villages was collected as of 2008, from farmer's field villages have gone into a database.

Bhavai is a folk musical performance of stage plays. Ketan Mehta and Sanjay Leela Bhansali explored artistic use of bhavai in films such as Bhavni Bhavai, Oh Darling! Yeh Hai India and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. Dayro (gathering) involves singing and conversation reflecting on human nature.\nMumbai theatre veteran, Alyque Padamsee, best known in the English-speaking world for playing Muhammad Ali Jinnah in Sir Richard Attenborough's Gandhi, was from a traditional Gujarati-Kutchi family from Kathiawar.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nGujarati food is primarily vegetarian. The typical Gujarati thali consists of rotli or bhakhari or thepala or rotlo, dal or kadhi, khichdi, Bhat and shak. Athanu (Indian pickle) and chhundo are used as condiments. The four major regions of Gujarat all bring their own styles to Gujarati food. Many Gujarati dishes are distinctively sweet, salty, and spicy at the same time. In the Saurashtra region, chhash (buttermilk) is believed to be a must-have in their daily food.", "start_char_idx": 53033, "end_char_idx": 55722, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51fedb00-315e-4d2f-8b37-efdd85808373": {"__data__": {"id_": "51fedb00-315e-4d2f-8b37-efdd85808373", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Gujarat.txt", "file_name": "Gujarat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79848, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bff12e6c-0923-4619-a979-34ae6f7de089", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Gujarat.txt", "file_name": "Gujarat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79848, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "6b6b68544c22f454fa9e7e5bd2f3d0ded82d6101ec778797c7847abc02b4ded3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6ce01d08-8c4b-476e-bb92-070923e09aec", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Gujarat.txt", "file_name": "Gujarat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79848, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "3477a54cc3e8154baaf78e9e32a3ccb92c765f6f71da0a40a3773d91e1cce375", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0779f257-8798-4768-804d-a1f316bbeaed", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bdd5351658af7aa404fb4cb3de4bc8047f4a87e3fc6f3f31d7c24d537b3cad9a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Cinema ===\n\nThe Gujarati film industry dates back to 1932, when the first Gujarati film, Narsinh Mehta, was released.

During the pre-modern period, various European sources have observed that these merchants formed diaspora communities outside of Gujarat, and in many parts of the world, such as the Persian Gulf, Middle East, Horn of Africa, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and Philippines. long before the internal rise of the Maratha dynasty, and the British Raj colonial occupation.Early 1st-century Western historians such as Strabo and Dio Cassius are testament to Gujarati people's role in the spread of Buddhism in the Mediterranean, when it was recorded that the sramana monk Zarmanochegas (\u0396\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c7\u03b7\u03b3\u1f70\u03c2) of Barygaza met Nicholas of Damascus in Antioch while Augustus ruled the Roman Empire, and shortly thereafter proceeded to Athens where died by setting himself on fire to demonstrate his faith. A tomb to the sramana, was still visible in the time of Plutarch, which bore the mention \"\u0396\u0391\u03a1\u039c\u0391\u039d\u039f\u03a7\u0397\u0393\u0391\u03a3 \u0399\u039d\u0394\u039f\u03a3 \u0391\u03a0\u039f \u0392\u0391\u03a1\u0393\u039f\u03a3\u0397\u03a3\" (\"The sramana master from Barygaza in India\").The progenitor of the Sinhala language is believed to have been Prince Vijaya, son of King Simhabahu, who ruled Simhapura (modern-day Sihor near Bhavnagar). Prince Vijaya was banished by his father for his lawlessness and set forth with a band of adventurers. This tradition was followed by other Gujaratis. For example, in the Ajanta frescoes, a Gujarati prince is shown entering Sri Lanka.Many Indians migrated to Indonesia and the Philippines, most of them Gujaratis. King Aji Saka, who is said to have come to Java in Indonesia in year 1 of the Saka calendar, is believed by some to have been a king of Gujarat. The first Indian settlements in the Philippines and Java Island of Indonesia are believed to have been established with the coming of Prince Dhruvavijaya of Gujarat, with 5000 traders. Some stories propose a Brahmin named Tritresta was the first to bring Gujarati migrants with him to Java, so some scholars equate him with Aji Saka. A Gujarati ship has been depicted in a sculpture at Borabudur, Java.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nGujarat's natural environment includes the Great Rann of Kutch and the hills of Saputara, and it is the sole home of pure Asiatic lions in the world. During the historic reigns of the sultans, Hindu craftsmanship blended with Islamic architecture, giving rise to the Indo-Saracenic style. Many structures in the state are built in this fashion. It is also the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, great iconic figures of India's Independence movement.

The heart of the La Habana Province, Havana is the country's main port and commercial center. It is the most populous city, the largest by area, and the second largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean region. The population in 2002 was 2,137,847 inhabitants, and its area is 728.26 km2 (281.18 sq mi) for the capital city side and 8,475.57 km\u00b2 for the metropolitan zone.Havana was founded by the Spanish in the 16th century. It served as a springboard for the Spanish conquest of the Americas, becoming a stopping point for Spanish galleons returning to Spain. Philip II of Spain granted Havana the title of capital in 1607. Walls and forts were built to protect the city.The city is the seat of the Cuban government and  various ministries, and headquarters of businesses and over 100 diplomatic offices. The governor is Reinaldo Garc\u00eda Zapata of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC). In 2009, the city/province had the third-highest income in the country.Contemporary Havana can essentially be described as three cities in one: Old Havana, Vedado and the newer suburban districts. The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbors: Marimelena, Guanabacoa and Antares. The Almendares River traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay.The city attracts over a million tourists annually; (1,176,627 international tourists in 2010, a 20% increase from 2005). Old Havana was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982. The city is also noted for its history, culture, architecture and monuments. As typical of Cuba, Havana experiences a tropical climate.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn 1514, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez founded the city San Crist\u00f3bal de la Habana, which meant \"Saint Christopher of the Habana\" and later became the capital of Cuba. Habana was the name of the local people group. It has been theorized that the name derived from Habaguanex, who was a chief of the Native American tribe. His name is Ta\u00edno, an Arawakan language, but nothing else is known. When Habana was adapted into English, the \u27e8b\u27e9 was switched to a \u27e8v\u27e9 because of a linguistic phenomenon known as betacism, which is a confusion between the voiced bilabial plosive and voiced labiodental fricative sounds that occurs in most modern Spanish dialects. Usage of the word Havana in literature understandably peaked during the Spanish\u2013American War, but it also represents a type of cigar, a color, and a type of rabbit as well as the city. Another theory for its etymology is that Havana comes from the Ta\u00edno word haba meaning \"hanging basket\" deriving from root affix ha- indicating something that hangs (cf. hamaka, 'hammock').:\u200a10,\u200a45\u20137\u200a Havana is still the prevailing name found in English language dictionaries in reference to the capital of Cuba.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2964, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79195fdd-27a6-470f-8c28-b9f34d6e9e74": {"__data__": {"id_": "79195fdd-27a6-470f-8c28-b9f34d6e9e74", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7464ab8d-dbf8-47c9-a4dc-22efe7a3141e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9233d2bae83c09ac94bc50385d45502d164e729c6e922d18f1dee31e60546ed2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "de798ce5-c3d1-4e1b-9cbf-3687e06f645a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "2cf2d22802e09218afb98686327baa4cd17f1259f611a7a5e00de7629de57dac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a3502a74-3411-466c-97b4-ca0b309e682d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "efe128ce385177c220287851b80af15e0e70b461b4bb1f1beb59d2c7c0319fe8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Coat of arms ==\n\nThe coat of arms of Havana consists of three castles that represent the three castles that defended the city: the Fuerza Castle, the Morro Castle and the Punta Castle. The key represents that Havana was the gateway to the New World. The shield, supported by an oak branch on one side and a laurel wreath on the other, symbolizes the strength of the nation, the laurel wreath, honor, and glory. These symbols represent the rights of man.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\nDiego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar founded Havana in 1514, on the southern coast of the island, near the present town of Surgidero de Bataban\u00f3 on the banks of the Mayabeque River close to Playa Mayabeque. However, all attempts to found a city on Cuba's south coast failed; an early map of Cuba drawn in 1514 places the town at the mouth of the river.Between 1514 and 1519 the Spanish established two settlements on the north coast, one of them in La Chorrera, around the site of the Torre\u00f3n de la Chorrera, what eventually became the neighborhoods of Vedado and Miramar, next to the mouth of the Almendares River. The town that became Havana originated adjacent to what was then called Puerto de Carenas (literally, \"Careening Port\"), in 1519. The quality of this natural bay, which now hosts Havana's harbor, warranted this change of location.\nP\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez gave Havana \u2013 the sixth town founded by the Spanish on Cuba \u2013 its name: San Crist\u00f3bal de la Habana. The name combines San Crist\u00f3bal, patron saint of Havana. Shortly after the founding of Cuba's first cities, the island served as little more than a base for the Conquista of other lands.\nHavana began as a trading port, and suffered regular attacks by buccaneers, pirates, and French corsairs. The first attack and resultant burning of the city was by the French corsair Jacques de Sores in 1555. Such attacks convinced the Spanish Crown to fund the construction of the first fortresses in the main cities \u2013 not only to counteract the pirates and corsairs, but also to exert more control over commerce with the West Indies, and to limit the extensive contrabando (black market) that had arisen due to the trade restrictions imposed by the Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n of Seville (the crown-controlled trading house that held a monopoly on New World trade).\nShips from all over the New World carried products first to Havana, to be taken by the fleet to Spain. The thousands of ships gathered in the city's bay also fueled Havana's agriculture and manufacture, since they had to be supplied with food, water, and other products needed to traverse the ocean.\nOn December 20, 1592, King Philip II of Spain granted Havana the title of City. Later on, the city would be officially designated as \"Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies\" by the Spanish Crown. In the meantime, efforts to build or improve the defensive infrastructures of the city continued.", "start_char_idx": 2967, "end_char_idx": 5873, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3502a74-3411-466c-97b4-ca0b309e682d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3502a74-3411-466c-97b4-ca0b309e682d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7464ab8d-dbf8-47c9-a4dc-22efe7a3141e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9233d2bae83c09ac94bc50385d45502d164e729c6e922d18f1dee31e60546ed2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "79195fdd-27a6-470f-8c28-b9f34d6e9e74", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "150e9cf55e1bb7f93ec2b437d8e41f777b8ed0e6f398821a56bec71840811a50", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b18ca7f1-0805-48b9-9383-4658431fe2b7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a2625ef7468a2a75af205737135c2ded46697612fd6cd91ad8c6246f82a8704c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== 17th century ===\n\nHavana expanded greatly in the 17th century. New buildings were constructed from the most abundant materials of the island, mainly wood, combining various Iberian architectural styles, as well as borrowing profusely from Canarian characteristics. During this period the city also built civic monuments and religious constructions. The convent of St Augustin, El Morro Castle, the chapel of the Humilladero, the fountain of Dorotea de la Luna in La Chorrera, the church of the Holy Angel, the hospital de San L\u00e1zaro, the monastery of Santa Teresa and the convent of San Felipe Neri were completed in this era.\nIn 1649 a fatal epidemic, brought from Cartagena in Colombia, affected a third of the population of Havana. On November 30, 1665, Queen Mariana of Austria, widow of King Philip IV of Spain, ratified the heraldic shield of Cuba, which took as its symbolic motifs the first three castles of Havana: the Real Fuerza, the Tres Santos Reyes Magos del Morro and San Salvador de la Punta. The shield also displayed a symbolic golden key to represent the title \"Key to the Gulf\". In 1674, the works for the City Walls were started, as part of the fortification efforts. They would be completed by 1740.\nBy the middle of the 18th century Havana had more than seventy thousand inhabitants, and was the third-largest city in the Americas, ranking behind Lima and Mexico City but ahead of Boston and New York City.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nDuring the 18th century Havana was the most important of the Spanish ports because it had facilities where ships could be refitted and, by 1740, it had become Spain's largest and most active shipyard and only drydock in the New World.The city was captured by the British during the Seven Years' War. The episode began on June 6, 1762, when at dawn, a British fleet, comprising more than 50 ships and a combined force of over 11,000 men of the Royal Navy and Army, sailed into Cuban waters and made an amphibious landing east of Havana. The British immediately opened up trade with their North American and Caribbean colonies, causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society. Less than a year after Havana was seized, the Peace of Paris was signed by the three warring powers thus ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain Florida in exchange for the return of the city of Havana on to Spain.After regaining the city, the Spanish transformed Havana into the most heavily fortified city in the Americas. Construction began on what was to become the Fortress of San Carlos de la Caba\u00f1a, the third biggest Spanish fortification in the New World after Castillo San Crist\u00f3bal (the biggest) and Castillo San Felipe del Morro both in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

Havana's theaters featured the most distinguished actors of the age, and prosperity among the burgeoning middle-class led to expensive new classical mansions being erected. During this period Havana became known as the Paris of the Antilles.\nIn 1837, the first railroad was constructed, a 51 km (32 mi) stretch between Havana and Bejucal, which was used for transporting sugar from the valley of G\u00fcines to the harbor. With this, Cuba became the fifth country in the world to have a railroad, and the first Spanish-speaking country. Throughout the century, Havana was enriched by the construction of additional cultural facilities, such as the Tac\u00f3n Theatre, one of the most luxurious in the world. The fact that slavery was legal in Cuba until 1886 led to Southern American interest, including a plan by the Knights of the Golden Circle to create a 'Golden Circle' with a 1200 mile-radius centered on Havana. After the Confederate States of America were defeated in the American Civil War in 1865, many former slaveholders continued to run plantations by moving to Havana.\nIn 1863, the city walls were knocked down so that the metropolis could be enlarged. At the end of the 19th century, Havana witnessed the final moments of Spanish presence in the Americas.\nThe sinking of the U.S. battleship Maine in Havana's harbor in 1898 was the immediate cause of the Spanish\u2013American War.", "start_char_idx": 8812, "end_char_idx": 10354, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c99a5608-05a4-4472-8749-5d6c8aadae3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c99a5608-05a4-4472-8749-5d6c8aadae3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7464ab8d-dbf8-47c9-a4dc-22efe7a3141e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9233d2bae83c09ac94bc50385d45502d164e729c6e922d18f1dee31e60546ed2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b18ca7f1-0805-48b9-9383-4658431fe2b7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "778ce3b2a97b979f76f858e473a34278932d1fb931369e6d8707f73fecf9be54", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "11dd782f-8a99-4d26-8754-e3db2773f3ae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d71e96fd96a61b08cbde41cc66e2afe8c590b3301ab044849c0a0ac8bae72b76", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Republican period ===\n\nCuba's first presidential period under Tom\u00e1s Estrada Palma from 1902 to 1906 was considered to uphold the highest standards of administrative integrity in the history of the Republic of Cuba. Initially he was the President of the Cuban Republic in Arms during the Ten Years' War and again between May 20, 1902, and September 28, 1906. His collateral career as a New York City Area Educator and writer enabled Estrada Palma to create Pro-Cuban literature aimed at gaining sympathy, assistance, and publicity. He was eventually successful in garnering the attention of influential Americans. Estrada Palma was an early and persistent voice calling for the United States to intervene in Cuba on humanitarian grounds. He was the first President of Cuba. During his presidency, his major accomplishments include improving Cuba's infrastructure, communication, and public health. He is remembered in Cuba however for allowing the Platt Amendment to be enacted, which ensured American political and economic dominance over Cuba.\nWhile Cuba had the highest ratio of hospital beds to population in Latin America, around 80% of these beds were located in the city of Havana, there was only one rural hospital and it was equipped with only 10 beds.\nIn 1951 the World Bank reported that between 80 and 90% of children in rural areas suffered from some form of intestinal parasites, in 1956 about 13% of the rural population had a history of typhoid and 14% at one point had tuberculosis. A study conducted in 1959 by public health authorities found that throughout the country around 72% of the population was afflicted with parasitism and in the rural areas this percentage was as high as 86.54%. Only 1 in 4 peasants were able to afford regularly eating meat, eggs and fish and chronic unemployment was at 25%. Cuba was a very unequal society with a mere 8% of landowners owning approximately 75% of the land, the bottom fifth of the population took in 2% of the national income meanwhile one-fifth of the population took in 58% of the national income this was one of the lowest rates for the bottom 20% in the world then and even now.\nCuba was also under a lot of influence from the United States to the point where the U.S. controlled 80% of Cuba's trade. In 1959 around 40% of Cuban sugar land, almost all the cattle ranches, 90% of mines and 80% of the utilities were owned by American firms.In 1958, Cuba was a relatively well-advanced country by Latin American standards, and in some cases by world standards. On the other hand, Cuba was affected by perhaps the largest labor union privileges in Latin America, including bans on dismissals and mechanization. They were obtained in large measure \"at the cost of the unemployed and the peasants\", leading to disparities. Between 1933 and 1958, Cuba extended economic regulations enormously, causing economic problems. Unemployment became a problem as graduates entering the workforce could not find jobs. The middle class, which was comparable to that of the United States, became increasingly dissatisfied with unemployment and political persecution. The labor unions supported Batista until the very end.

In particular, it transformed Cuba\u2013United States relations, although efforts to improve diplomatic relations have gained momentum in recent years such as the Cuban thaw. In the immediate aftermath of the revolution, Castro's government began a program of nationalization, centralization of the press and political consolidation that transformed Cuba's economy and civil society. The revolution also heralded an era of Cuban medical internationalism and Cuban intervention in foreign conflicts in Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. Several rebellions occurred in the six years following 1959, mainly in the Escambray Mountains, which were defeated by the revolutionary government.\nAfter the revolution of 1959, the new government under Fidel Castro began to improve social services, public housing, and official buildings. Nevertheless, after Castro's abrupt expropriation of all private property and industry (May 1959 onwards) under a strong communist model backed by the Soviet Union followed by the U.S. embargo, shortages that affected Cuba in general hit Havana especially hard. By 1966\u201368, the Cuban government had nationalized all privately owned business entities in Cuba, down to \"certain kinds of small retail forms of commerce\" as per law No. 1076.An economic downturn occurred after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Soviet subsidies ended, representing billions of dollars which the Soviet Union had given the Cuban government. Many believed the revolutionary government would soon collapse, as happened to the Soviet satellite states of Eastern Europe.\nAfter many years of economic struggle and prohibition, the socialist government has turned to tourism for revenue and has brought foreign investors to remodel the nationalized, former Manzana de Gomez building, and turn it into the Gran Hotel Manzana Kempinski La Habana, a new 5-star hotel attempting to develop a new hospitality industry. In Old Havana, a number of streets and squares have been rehabilitated in an effort to rebuild for tourists.

The city has little autonomy and is dependent upon the national government, particularly, for much of its budgetary and overall political direction.\n\nVoters elect delegates to Municipal Assemblies in competitive elections every five years, and the Municipal Assemblies are responsible for each of the city's boroughs. These assemblies elect the borough presidents and vice presidents, which are equivalents to mayors and vice mayors in the other provinces. There is only one political party, the Communist Party, but since there must be a minimum of two candidates, members of the Communist Party often run against each other. Candidates are not required to be members of the party. They are nominated directly by citizens in open meetings within each election district. Municipal Assembly delegates within the boroughs in turn elect members of the Provincial Council (until 2019 the Provincial Assembly), which in Havana serves roughly as the City Council; its president appoints the Governor and Vice Governor, who serve as the Mayor and Vice Mayor of Havana and can be either elected by the council or appointed by the president with council confirmation. There are direct elections for the city's deputies to the National Assembly based on slates, and a portion of the candidates is nominated at the local level. The People's Councils (Consejos Populares) consist of local city delegates who elect a full-time representative to preside over the body. These councils are directly responsible for the city's neighbourhoods and wards. In addition, there is involvement of \"mass organizations\" and representatives of local government agencies, industries and services. The 105 People's Councils in Havana cover an average of 20,000 residents.Havana city borders are contiguous with the Mayabeque Province on the south and east and to Artemisa Province on the west, since former La Habana Province (rural) was abolished in 2010.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nHavana lies on the northern coast of Cuba along the Straits of Florida, south of the Florida Keys, where the Gulf of Mexico joins the Atlantic Ocean. The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbors: Marimelena, Guanabacoa, and Atar\u00e9s. The Almendares River traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay.\nThere are low hills on which the city lies rise gently from the waters of the straits. A noteworthy elevation is the 200-foot-high (60-meter) limestone ridge that slopes up from the east and culminates in the heights of La Caba\u00f1a and El Morro, the sites of Spanish fortifications overlooking the eastern bay. Another notable rise is the hill to the west that is occupied by the University of Havana and the Castillo del Pr\u00edncipe (Havana).", "start_char_idx": 16359, "end_char_idx": 19475, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f12a66f-3fc3-4ca4-89b3-caabb1361fef": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f12a66f-3fc3-4ca4-89b3-caabb1361fef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7464ab8d-dbf8-47c9-a4dc-22efe7a3141e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9233d2bae83c09ac94bc50385d45502d164e729c6e922d18f1dee31e60546ed2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3fc7c07e-a160-4796-bae2-b508b1badc2b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "f035f02b78dea1827d8332d874e47d08a069e564b2468ad9cfefd1a5c8464c3e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1f5b9027-dd48-476b-88c6-8aa4448bff62", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a6850fac4b40276630c6ec6977da64c55b213ff8d6421ea016ac3af371d2263b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Climate ===\nHavana has a tropical climate that is tempered by the island's position in the belt of the trade winds and by the warm offshore currents.

By February 4, the death toll had increased to six, with 11 people still in critical condition.The table lists temperature averages:", "start_char_idx": 19478, "end_char_idx": 20923, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f5b9027-dd48-476b-88c6-8aa4448bff62": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f5b9027-dd48-476b-88c6-8aa4448bff62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7464ab8d-dbf8-47c9-a4dc-22efe7a3141e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9233d2bae83c09ac94bc50385d45502d164e729c6e922d18f1dee31e60546ed2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7f12a66f-3fc3-4ca4-89b3-caabb1361fef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "630157a38169423d2f4cf04632c5d8a9b27103aa1907ace1c8b59f8b5e4c38c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "97f5e472-be24-4434-a830-84f0c7585b29", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c9a1aff8bd2cc118c4109467a2cffccab4388c8066aac5327fe398bfda4731b0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Municipalities ===\nThe city is divided into 15 municipalities \u2013 or boroughs, which are further subdivided into 105 wards (consejos populares).\n\nPlaya: Santa Fe, Siboney, Cubanac\u00e1n, Ampliaci\u00f3n Almendares, Miramar, Sierra, Ceiba, Buena Vista.\nPlaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n: El Carmelo, Vedado-Malec\u00f3n, Rampa, Pr\u00edncipe, Plaza, Nuevo Vedado-Puentes Grandes, Col\u00f3n-Nuevo Vedado, Vedado.\nCentro Habana: Cayo Hueso, Pueblo Nuevo, Los Sitios, Dragones, Col\u00f3n.\nLa Habana Vieja: Prado, Catedral, Plaza Vieja, Bel\u00e9n, San Isidro, Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda, Tallapiedra.\nRegla: Guaicanimar, Loma Modelo, Casablanca.\nLa Habana del Este: Camilo Cienfuegos, Coj\u00edmar, Guiteras, Alturas de Alamar, Alamar Este, Guanabo, Campo Florido, Alamar-Playa.\nGuanabacoa: Ma\u00f1ana-Habana Nueva, Villa I, Villa II, Chivas-Roble, Debeche-Nalon, Hata-Naranjo, Pe\u00f1alver-Bacuranao, Minas-Barreras.\nSan Miguel del Padr\u00f3n: Rocafort, Luyan\u00f3 Moderno, Diezmero, San Francisco de Paula, Dolores-Veracruz, Jacomino.\nDiez de Octubre: Luyan\u00f3, Jes\u00fas del Monte, Lawton, Vista Alegre, Goyle, Sevillano, La V\u00edbora, Santos Su\u00e1rez, Tamarindo.\nCerro: Latinoamericano, Pilar-Atares, Cerro, Las Ca\u00f1as, El Canal, Palatino, Armada.\nMarianao: CAI-Los \u00c1ngeles, Pocito-Palmas, Zamora-Cocosolo, Libertad, Pogoloti-Bel\u00e9n-Finlay, Santa Felicia.\nLa Lisa : Alturas de La Lisa, Balc\u00f3n Arimao, El Cano-Valle Grande-Bello 26 y Morado, Punta Brava, Arroyo Arenas, San Agust\u00edn, Versalles-Coronela.\nBoyeros: Santiago de Las Vegas, Nuevo Santiago, Boyeros, Wajay, Calabazar, Altahabana-Capdevila, Armada-Aldab\u00f3.\nArroyo Naranjo: Los Pinos, Poey, V\u00edbora Park, Mantilla, P\u00e1rraga, Calvario-Fraternidad, Guinera, El\u00e9ctrico, Managua, Callejas.\nCotorro: San Pedro-Centro Cotorro, Santa Maria del Rosario, Loter\u00eda, Cuatro Caminos, Magdalena-Torriente, Alberro.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nHavana has diverse styles of architecture, from castles built in the 16th century, to modernist high-rise buildings.\nThe present condition of many structures have deteriorated since 1959 or have been demolished, including the demolition of the Plaza del Vapor, built in 1835 by the architect of the Palacio de la Marquesa de Villalba, Eugenio Rayneri Sorrentino, the father of Eugenio Rayneri Piedra the architect of the El Capitolio of 1929.

As a result, Havana was the most heavily fortified city in the Americas. Most examples of early architecture can be seen in military fortifications such as La Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabana (1558\u20131577) designed by Battista Antonelli and the Castillo del Morro (1589\u20131630). This sits at the entrance of Havana Bay and provides an insight into the supremacy and wealth at that time.\nOld Havana was also protected by a defensive wall begun in 1674 but had already overgrown its boundaries when it was completed in 1767, becoming the new neighborhood of Centro Habana. The influence from different styles and cultures can be seen in Havana's Spanish architecture, with a diverse range of Mud\u00e9jar architecture, Spanish, Italian, Greek and Roman. The San Carlos and San Ambrosio Seminary (18th century) is a good example of early Spanish influenced architecture. The Havana cathedral (1748\u20131777) dominating the Plaza de la Catedral (1749) is the best example of Cuban Baroque. Surrounding it are the former palaces of the Count de Casa-Bayona (1720\u20131746) Marquis de Arcos (1746) and the Marquis de Aguas Claras (1751\u20131775).\n\n\n===== Iglesia del Esp\u00edritu =====\n\nThe Iglesia del Esp\u00edritu Santo at No. 161 Calle Acosta was built in 1635 on the corner of Calles Cuba and Acosta. Free blacks, already numerous, devoted it to the Holy Spirit in 1638. The Esp\u00edritu Santo contains some notable paintings including a seated, post-crucifixion Christ on the right wall, and catacombs. It is considered one of the oldest temples in Havana and it is said that its main interest lies essentially in the simplicity of the beautiful stone construction.The church was rebuilt and expanded in 1648 and given the rank of a parish. During the Spanish era it had exceptional importance, since by a Papal Bull of 1772 and a Royal Certificate of 1773, of Charles III of Spain, it was declared \"\u00danica Iglesia inmune en esta ciudad, construida en 1855.\" (\"the only immune church in this city, built-in 1855.\"), which meant that any persecuted individual could find Amparo (sanctuary) in it against the action of the authorities or of justice. A metal plaque at the foot of the bell tower attests to this fact.Many illustrious people of Havana were baptized in this church, among them the educator Jos\u00e9 de la Luz y Caballero. Bishop Ger\u00f3nimo Vald\u00e9s, a founder of La Casa de Beneficencia y Maternidad de La Habana, was buried in the Church; the master sepulcher of Bishop Vald\u00e9s was found in 1936.\nThere are original paintings by the Cuban painter Jos\u00e9 Nicol\u00e1s de la Escalera (\"Cuba's first painter\") and Aristides Fernandez (20th century), among them the large oil painting titled The Burial of Christ.\nThe Iglesia del Esp\u00edritu Santo's greatest interest from an architectural point of view lies in the simplicity of the coral stone construction and the lack of lavish decoration. Other elements of great importance are the funerary crypts that were discovered in 1953. The crypt is from times before the Col\u00f3n Cemetery (1876) in El Vedado was built. The crypt is entered from the left of the altar and contains several catacombs.", "start_char_idx": 23356, "end_char_idx": 26610, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d36dc22-85a7-443b-8773-1fddfb2d3012": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d36dc22-85a7-443b-8773-1fddfb2d3012", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7464ab8d-dbf8-47c9-a4dc-22efe7a3141e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9233d2bae83c09ac94bc50385d45502d164e729c6e922d18f1dee31e60546ed2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "97f5e472-be24-4434-a830-84f0c7585b29", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "d18c285aa9c18fe2bfe810cd83bbf0380ee0552cb5eaf458e5581c227ba82d6e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1a36819d-b04b-4614-8aa0-eef49a58ec9b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d95eed7e25ec83b82d5cc7091ed3a859c5a7a20680245a23deb83924202a2193", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "====== Cuban uni-nave ======\nThe building was built in the \"uni-nave\" style, as pointed out by Joaqu\u00edn Weiss, a Cuban architect, and historian and one of the most authoritative authorities on the subject. Uni-nave was the style of Cuban religious constructions in the seventeenth century and meant that it originally had only one central nave. An additional side nave in the first years of the 18th century, the bell tower was built and around 1720 the vault of the presbytery was built. In 1760, Bishop D. Pedro Morell of Santa Cruz ordered the construction of a nave (8x29 m) lateral to the main temple nave.The church sits on a plinth of about 18 cm that may be seen along Calles Cuba and Acosta. The building is 60m long as measured on the exterior, east\u2013west along Calle Acosta, although from the interior it appears that the last 10m was a later addition as the walls of this ten-meter square room are thinner (along Calle Acosta) and the roof structure does not span the ten-meter dimension. There is a column in the middle of the room to distribute the weight of the roof.\nThere are seven bays of approximately fifty-seven centimeters in length along the main nave. The first bay at the entrance is the shortest of about five meters in length and contains a balcony above which is reached by the stairs of the belfry. The elliptical arch supported by matching pilasters at opposite walls date from 1808 which is the year of the construction of the bell tower. In the middle of the 19th century, the entire wall that faces Acosta Street was rebuilt and the main fa\u00e7ade was remodeled. The three-story bell-tower was built in the year 1808 and it is located immediately to the left of the church upon entering, it is one of the tallest structures in Old Havana. The tower was built by the master Pedro Hern\u00e1ndez de Santiago.There are five windows along the Calle Acosta wall and, except for the window in the presbytery which aligns with the center of the room, do not align with the grid of the columns. Thus the windows appear to be haphazardly placed without regard for the geometry of the nave or the rhythm of the structure.\n\n\n====== Ceiling ======\nThe roof of the church terminates on the interior in a wooden ceiling of paired cross-tie braces and hidden tie backs springing from every column and supported on wooden corbels. The wood cross-tie brace ceiling is a common construction in Havana and may be seen in the wooden ceiling of the Church of Santo Cristo del Buen Viaje at Amargura and Cristo Streets in Havana Vieja and Iglesia de Santa Clara de Asis.\n\n\n===== Iglesia de San Francisco de Paula =====\n\nThe Alameda de Paula was the first promenade in Cuba, designed and constructed in 1776 by Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez Trevejo, following the instructions of the Laureano de Torres y Ayala, it was created on the site of the old Rinc\u00f3n refuse dump. It was an embankment with two rows of poplar trees and some benches, it became one of Havana's most important social and cultural spaces, it was the model of the Paseo del Prado designed in 1925. It was given the name Alameda de Paula because of its proximity to the old Hospital and Iglesia of San Francisco de Paula. Between 1803 and 1805 the pavement was tiled, a fountain and stone benches, lampposts and the marble column were added, it qualified as a pleasant entertainment for the residents of the Villa de San Crist\u00f3bal, lacking recreational sites at that time.", "start_char_idx": 26613, "end_char_idx": 30040, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a36819d-b04b-4614-8aa0-eef49a58ec9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "1a36819d-b04b-4614-8aa0-eef49a58ec9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7464ab8d-dbf8-47c9-a4dc-22efe7a3141e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9233d2bae83c09ac94bc50385d45502d164e729c6e922d18f1dee31e60546ed2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7d36dc22-85a7-443b-8773-1fddfb2d3012", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "7bc3b2e3817bebc36bb175c5d92f7458d7b7204a5c58c8e482dab00b20eef35a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9b5b1915-dfc0-44cc-80a2-5c2312ad8a35", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "79a313531020c6bd91cda411f267c0699c178d6f4288370b9121f8296ee8175a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Between 1803 and 1805 the pavement was tiled, a fountain and stone benches, lampposts and the marble column were added, it qualified as a pleasant entertainment for the residents of the Villa de San Crist\u00f3bal, lacking recreational sites at that time.\nIn 1841, the stairs that gave access to the promenade were widened and several lampposts were added. In the year 2000, the Havana promenade was restored and extended until it reached the Iglesia de San Francisco de Paula.Towards the end of the 17th century, the first stone of what would be the hospital for women and the church of San Francisco de Paula was placed, the buildings were expanded in 1731 with the support and donations from the City Council and orders of the different General Captains in command of the island. In 1776, it was the most important hospital in Havana, there were several generations of famous doctors that trained here.The Presbyter of the Cathedral of Havana, don Nicol\u00e1s Est\u00e9vez Borges, in 1664 ordered the construction of a Hospital for Women and an adjoining church devoted to Saint Francis of Paola who was one of the founders of the Roman Catholic Order of the Minims.  San Francisco de Paula (1416\u20131507) was a hermit, famous for his humility and his miracles. His party is celebrated on April 2.\nBoth buildings were completely destroyed by a hurricane in 1730 and were rebuilt and enlarged in 1745 in the Baroque style we see today, resulting in the Royal Hospital of Havana and the Church of San Francisco de Paula.The Havana Central Railroad, a U. S. company, in 1907 attempted to acquire the temple for its own corporate use. The Central Railroad's several attempts to acquire and eventually demolish the church were frustrated by the opposition of historian Emilio Roig de Leuchsenring and anthropologist don Fernando Ortiz. Their efforts not only stopped the demolition of the church but also got it listed as National Monument in 1944. Havana Central Railroads, however, was able to bring down the hospital upon approval from the relevant authorities at the time.\nAn example of the pre-Churrigueresque Baroque style, the floor plan of the Iglesia de San Francisco de Paula is typologically similar to the Iglesia de San Francisco de As\u00eds as both ground plans are based on a Latin cross. The fa\u00e7ade has a central arched doorway and columns at the sides, typical of Spanish churches. There is a belfry in the front, but the 3 bells were never recovered after the hurricane of 1730. The Office of the City Historian restored the stained glass windows.\nThe Iglesia de San Francisco de Paula is a representative example of the Cuban Baroque of the first half of the 18th century.

In the second half of the 18th century, sugar and coffee production increased rapidly, which became essential in the development of Havana's most prominent architectural style. Many wealthy Habaneros took their inspiration from the French; this can be seen within the interiors of upper-class houses such as the Aldama Palace built in 1844. This is considered the most important neoclassical residential building in Cuba and typifies the design of many houses of this period with portales of neoclassical columns facing open spaces or courtyards.\nIn 1925 Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier, the head of urban planning in Paris moved to Havana for five years to collaborate with architects and landscape designers. In the master planning of the city his aim was to create a harmonic balance between the classical built form and the tropical landscape. He embraced and connected the city's road networks while accentuating prominent landmarks. His influence has left a huge mark on Havana although many of his ideas were cut short by the great depression in 1929. During the first decades of the 20th century Havana expanded more rapidly than at any time during its history. Great wealth prompted architectural styles to be influenced from abroad. The peak of Neoclassicism came with the construction of the Vedado district (begun in 1859). This area features a number of set back well-proportioned buildings in the Neoclassical style.", "start_char_idx": 32854, "end_char_idx": 34754, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "080951fb-809b-45e3-94bf-1c8e05b23951": {"__data__": {"id_": "080951fb-809b-45e3-94bf-1c8e05b23951", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7464ab8d-dbf8-47c9-a4dc-22efe7a3141e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9233d2bae83c09ac94bc50385d45502d164e729c6e922d18f1dee31e60546ed2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b5b1915-dfc0-44cc-80a2-5c2312ad8a35", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "f76aa0608abdd3a083015865cfee8888160ffb54e43eb1d5ae224f70e76e3585", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3327edc6-5e64-4403-9d4e-dedb24e5a65b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7aeeb83e99ab8e75f39be792a08310ac4ee28c24ae52cc85b262a56f220c393b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "===== Palacio de la Marquesa de Villalba =====\n\nBuilt in 1875, in the Reparto de las Las Murallas, (wide strip of land that remained after the city walls were demolished in 1863), it was the work of the architect Eugenio Rayneri y Sorrentino. Around 1880 the mansion was owned by the Count of Casa Mor\u00e9. The \"La Flor de Jos\u00e9 Murias\" tobacco factory was installed in the building. Later, through the exploitation of rents, it became a tenement house. In 1951 some of its spaces were dedicated to housing. On its upper floor, the Spanish Center and the Israeli Center of Cuba had their headquarters.\n\nThe palace of the Marquesa de Villalba and the Mercado de Tac\u00f3n were designed by the Eugenio Rayneri y Sorrentino at almost the same time, 1875 and 1876, respectively, each in a style that accommodated the particular typology (residential and commercial) thus conceiving each work with the formal element accommodating different aesthetic requirements.\nThe property is, after the Aldama Palace, the strongest example of Cuban Neoclassicism. The palace of the Marquesa de Villalba is in the neoclassical style, perhaps only comparable in Havana \u2013 according to Alina Castellanos \u2013 to the Aldama Palace. But while the latter limits the decoration to the natural slenderness of the colonnade, in the most classical way of the Greek Parthenon, the former uses Roman and Renaissance elaborations, hence, the arcade has been projected on pillars, the building was crowned with a considerable cornice. The neoclassical decoration can also be seen in the window covers, which take alternate forms of a triangular or semicircular pediment, and glass over the door, similar to the Plaza del Vapor.Some interior spaces and the openings to the street on the ground floor have been heavily modified, it is still possible to appreciate the monumentality of the building in its three street facades, well proportioned, with a portal composed of a semicircular arcade that culminates in pointed arches at the ends. There are openings on the upper floor, which are alternately topped by triangular or semicircular pediments, a detail that shows a strong influence of the Italian Renaissance, which makes the Palacio one of the most openly academic of the period. There is an unusual Corinthian pilaster order attached to the upper floor, and the main portal by Calle Egido, resolved in a semicircular arch with and a cast iron door.

Built in 1840 by the Dominican architect and engineer Manuel Jos\u00e9 Carrera, its main facade of columns spans one block on Calle Amistad between Calles Reina and Estrella.\n\nThe Aldama Palace was assaulted by Spanish volunteers on the night of the January 24, 1869. Its owner at that time, Don Miguel de Aldama and Alfonso \u2013 son of the building's builder \u2013 was a recognized enemy of Spain and conspirator since Narciso L\u00f3pez's time. A man so rich and powerful that, despite his ideas and pro Cuban views, Spain, far from punishing him, wanted to attract him with the offer of the title of marquis; Don Miguel refused. In addition, there was another reason that prompted the most intransigent Spanish element, represented by the volunteers, to the looting of that mansion and was the insistent rumor that, by the will of its owner, that royal palace would be the residence of the future presidents of Cuba.Thus, the Spanish Volunteer Corps assaulted the palace under the pretext that Domingo del Monte had a catch of weapons inside of the Palacio. The looting of the Aldama Palace, three months after the start of the first war for independence, is linked to various events that took place under the command of Captain General Domingo Dulce y Garay, Marquis of Castell-Florit, whose main cause was the encounter between the Spaniards and the Cubans and the hostility that the volunteers felt for the ruler whom they held as weak, and whom they accused of complicity in events contrary to Spain, including, those of Miguel Aldama.\nStreet riots had occurred on January 12 after the volunteers during a search had found a stash of weapons in a house on Calle Carmen during the burial of Camilo Cepeda, a young Cuban killed in jail. The Volunteers returned on the 24th and a troop of them fired their weapons into the El Louvre caf\u00e9, those who tried to flee, were attacked by bayonet. There were seven dead and numerous wounded, all of them Spanish.The Third and Fifth battalions, and the Ligeros battalion, concentrated before the Palace and knocked down one of the doors. They said to look for weapons and, indeed, they found them, but not of those that could be used in the manigua in the war against Spain, it was a collection of ancient weapons \u2014\u2014Japanese, Hindu, Norman, Inca, etc.\u2014\u2014 that the Aldama family had collected. The Spanish Volunteers destroyed the art gallery and searched the cabinets and appropriated everything that could be taken, what could not be carried, they destroyed: crockery, lamps, crystals, books, art objects of all kinds. They set fire to the damask or lace curtains and doors and windows were torn off of the masonry, or shot.

The building had two elevators and a fire-protected staircase. In the 1930s, the hotel was bought by Pascual Mor\u00e1n P\u00e9rez, a businessman of Spanish origin who stood out in the field of hospitality in Cuba.

He marketed his hotel as the best and most central in the city.\nn the 1960s this hotel was nationalized, like many other properties in the city. There is no exact reference to how and when, but the building gradually became family homes. The practice of expropriating hotels and converting them into multi-family buildings was one of the strategies of the revolutionary state to solve the housing problem in Cuba.The commercial function of the ground floor has been preserved to date, taking advantage of its excellent location on Boulevard de San Rafael.

It is located on the corner of Calles Monserrate and San Juan de Dios on a 1,320 sq meter lot in Las Murallas, Old Havana. The building is in the art deco style that was popular internationally in the early decades of the 20th century.\nThe Bacardi Building was designed to be the headquarters for the Bacardi Rum Company; it was nationalized by the Castro government in the early 1960s. In 2001, the building was restored by an Italian construction firm. The interior retains the original decorations in marble and granite. It is regarded as one of the finest Art Deco buildings in Latin America.The building was the outcome of an architectural design competition. The owners of the Bacardi company invited a number of architects to present their design proposals for a new headquarters building offering 1,000 pesos to the winner. The competition was made up of a panel of judges that included Henri Schueg Chassin, president of Bacardi, and the architects Leonardo Morales y Pedroso, the architect for Colegio Belen, Enrique Gil, Emilio de Soto, and Pedro Mart\u00ednez Incl\u00e1n. The first prize was awarded to architects Esteban Rodr\u00edguez-Castells and Rafael Fern\u00e1ndez Ruenes. Jos\u00e9 Men\u00e9ndez Men\u00e9ndez was the architect-engineer in the project.Construction of the building started on January 6, 1930, and was completed by the 300-day deadline the company had set for December. Poor conditions of the land required that the foundation use piles of hardwood (jiqui and j\u00facaro negro) and high strength concrete. At the peak of the building (47 m) is a bronze sculpture of the company logo, a fruit bat. Its design gives the building a unique chromatic effect and a decorative element of Catalan modernism. At the brim of the building are inflected flat panel sculptures of sirens.\n\nThe first floor contained a bar with column archways where patrons of the restaurant in the mezzanine area could overlook the bar while they dined. It was open to the public and known to have many celebrities who frequented. Most of the marble and granite were imported from Europe: Germany, Sweden, Norway, Italy, France, Belgium and Hungary.\nWith an area of 1,075 sq. meters and 7.25 meters of support, the first floor walls, floor, and ceiling are adorned in pink granite from Bavaria, and the two halls are of green marble from floor to ceiling. The construction work was carried out by the company Grasyma of Wansiedel, Bavaria of Germany, which took great care in the fine details of the work and the time sensitivity of the project deadline.\nThe property has a cistern with capacity for 8,700 US gallons (33,000 L; 7,200 imp gal) of water, which pumped into a tank inside the tower with capacity for 4,800 US gallons (18,000 L; 4,000 imp gal). In addition, it has four elevators for different uses: two are used for passengers with a capacity of 10 people each and a speed of 350 feet per minute; another is a cargo elevator for the transportation of furniture, with a capacity of 4,000 pounds (1,800 kg); and the fourth one makes trips between the basement and the first floor to transport goods.\nConstruction was completed in December 1930 and at the time it was the tallest building in Havana.", "start_char_idx": 42064, "end_char_idx": 45455, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b225693-4d59-456a-b2bf-e3bc7f20294a": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b225693-4d59-456a-b2bf-e3bc7f20294a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7464ab8d-dbf8-47c9-a4dc-22efe7a3141e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9233d2bae83c09ac94bc50385d45502d164e729c6e922d18f1dee31e60546ed2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2fb68f55-d8d3-465f-b166-9db7b815cac4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9b72fa2108b962518fe07d0e578cbcc3f67b232503c4629d8e7a7c77e460fea6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1bf6609c-2f24-4e4d-85ef-6051fed698f3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a3a85e1b740e2cd1df7e72826d1b9df96a9ad1ec84334175f664c92589c9791", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "===== L\u00f3pez Serrano Building =====\n\nDesigned by the architect Ricardo Mira in 1929, who in 1941 designed La Moderna Poesia bookstore on Obispo Street for the same owner, the L\u00f3pez Serrano Building was the tallest residential building in Cuba until the construction of the FOCSA Building in 1956. The congressman, senator, and presidential candidate Eduardo Chib\u00e1s was living on the fourteenth-floor penthouse when he committed suicide in August 1951 on the air at CMQ Radio Station.\n\nThe construction of the building was promoted by Jos\u00e9 Antonio L\u00f3pez Serrano, a publisher who ran La Moderna Poes\u00eda. He was the son of Ana Lu\u00edsa Serrano and Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Rodr\u00edguez, \"Pote\", a banker with ties to publishing.Pote arrived in Cuba as a poor and illiterate teenager who became an influential banker with ties to the government. In 1890 Pote married Ana Lu\u00edsa Serrano, a wealthy widow who owned one of the best bookstores in Havana, La Moderna Poes\u00eda. After the marriage, Pote took charge of the business opening several branches in other locations in Cuba. Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez's fortune was due not only to his advantageous marriage to Ana Lu\u00edsa but also from supporting the Cuban independence cause. Relations with the main Cuban leaders would bring important economic benefits. Among these political alliances was the figure of General Jos\u00e9 Miguel G\u00f3mez, whom Pote financed the 1907 electoral campaign that would propel G\u00f3mez to the Presidency of the Republic. In 1908 Pote got an exclusive contract to print the tickets of the National Lottery, which translated into extensive financial benefits. He monopolized the printing of official documents such as bonds, stocks, stamps and bank notes, printed in La Casa del Timbre. Later, he would obtain from the Government of G\u00f3mez the concession for the construction of an iron bridge over the Almendares River connecting Calle Calzada with Miramar. Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Rodr\u00edguez committed suicide on March 28, 1921, at the time, he had accumulated 93 million dollars.\n\n\n==== Modernism ====\nKnown by buildings of high-quality, modernist architecture transformed much of the city. Examples are the Havana Hilton Hotel of (1958), the Radiocentro CMQ Building of 1955 by Mart\u00edn Dom\u00ednguez Esteban architect of the FOCSA Building in 1956, and the Edificio del Seguro M\u00e9dico, Havana by Antonio Quintana Simonetti.\n\n\n===== Hotel Tryp Habana Libre =====\n\nHotel Tryp Habana Libre is one of the larger hotels in Cuba, situated in Vedado, Havana. The hotel has 572 rooms in a 25-floor tower at Calle 23 (\"La Rampa\") and Calle L. Opened in 1958 as the Habana Hilton, the hotel famously served as the residence of Fidel Castro and other revolutionaries throughout 1959, after their capture of Havana.\nThe Habana Hilton was constructed at a cost of $24 million, under the personal auspices of President Fulgencio Batista. It was built as an investment by the Caja de Retiro y Asistencia Social de los Trabajadores Gastronomicos, the pension plan of the Cuban catering workers' union, with additional financing from the Banco de Fomento Agricola e Industrial de Cuba (BANFAIC). It was operated by the American Hilton Hotels International group and was designed by the well-known Los Angeles architect Welton Becket, who had previously designed the Beverly Hilton for the chain.

Becket designed the 27-story Habana Hilton in collaboration with Havana-based architects Lin Arroyo, and Gabriela Men\u00e9ndez. Arroyo was the Minister of Public Works under Batista. The hotel was constructed by the Frederick Snare Corporation.The architectural historian Peter Moruzzi, author of Havana Before Castro, notes what the Hilton meant to Batista:\n\n \"Batista considered the Habana Hilton among his proudest achievements, its huge blue-lit rooftop 'Hilton' name announcing to the world that the eminent Conrad Hilton had confidence in Cuba's future \u2013 that the country was a safe place in which to invest \u2013 and that tourists could now find in Havana the modern comforts they expected in a top international resort.\"\nThe Habana Hilton was Latin America's tallest and largest hotel. It boasted 630 guest rooms, including 42 suites; an elegant casino; six restaurants and bars, including a Trader Vic's and a rooftop bar; a huge supper club; extensive convention facilities; a shopping arcade; an outdoor pool surrounded by cabanas; and two underground garages with a capacity of 500 cars. The hotel also featured artwork commissioned from some of the most important Cuban modern artists of the day, including an enormous mosaic mural by Amelia Pel\u00e1ez over the main entrance and a tiled wall mural by Ren\u00e9 Portocarrero in the second-floor Antilles Bar overlooking the pool terrace.\nThe Habana Hilton opened with five days of festivities, from March 19\u201323, 1958, with Conrad Hilton himself in attendance, joined by his companion, actress Ann Miller. Hilton was joined by 300 invited guests, including socialite Virginia Warren, daughter of Chief Justice Earl Warren; renowned Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper; actress Terry Moore; actress Dorothy Johnson; married radio hosts Tex McCrary and Jinx Falkenburg; actress Linda Cristal; dancer Vera-Ellen; actor Don Murray; actress Dolores Hart; ABC network President Leonard Goldenson; and journalist Leonard Lyons. A formal blessing ceremony was held in the hotel's lobby on March 22, 1958, attended by Cuba's First Lady, Marta Fernandez de Batista; Francisco Aguirre, head of the catering workers' union; Jos\u00e9 Su\u00e1rez Rivas, Minister of Labor; and other dignitaries. The ceremony was followed by a luncheon, with speeches by Hilton and Aguirre, and a huge gala dinner and ball in the hotel's grand ballroom.\nThe casino in the hotel was leased for $1 million a year to a group consisting of Roberto \"Chiri\" Mendoza, his brother Mario Mendoza, Clifford \"Big Juice\" Jones, Kenneth F. Johnson, and Sidney Orseck. Roberto Mendoza was a wealthy Cuban contractor and sugar planter who was a business associate of President Batista; Mario Mendoza was a lawyer; Orseck was an attorney from New York; Johnson was a senator in the Nevada state legislature and Jones was a former lieutenant governor of Nevada who had ownership interests in a number of Las Vegas casinos. Hilton officials said that 13 groups tried to lease the casino and 12 were \"turned down because they either had underworld connections or had refused to subject themselves to rigid investigation.\" Speculation surfaced that the murder of Gambino crime family boss Albert Anastasia in October 1957 was tied to his interest in securing an ownership stake in the Hilton's casino.

The police investigation of the murder focused on this theory for a while but later looked at other theories. The murder was never solved.\n\n\n===== Radiocentro CMQ Building =====\n\nThe Radiocentro CMQ Building complex is a former radio and television production facility and office building at the intersection of Calle L and La Rampa in El Vedado, Cuba. It was modeled after Raymond Hood's 1933 Rockefeller Center in New York City. With 1,650 seats, the theater first opened on December 23, 1947, under the name Teatro Warner Radiocentro, it was owned by brothers Goar and Abel Mestre. Today the building serves as the headquarters of the Cuban Institute of Radio and Television (ICRT).\n\nFor the construction of this building, the Havana building authorities granted a permit in 1947 amending the ordinances that were then in effect in El Vedado prohibiting the construction of buildings of more than three storeys. This statute was modified six years later to expand the construction of up to four floors because many planners and owners claimed the need to authorize them to build taller buildings in the area.The building was set back from the property line five meters, adding four meters for an arcade which allowed a distance from the road while adjusting to the strong slope of 23rd Street, in this way the arcade became a wide gallery and at the same time sub-divided the basement level.\nThis gallery became the covered hall of the cinema located in the upper corner with Calle L. The building had an expressionist curved cover of a large scale relating to the important intersection. This same scale was adopted in the restaurant that was located on the opposite corner on M. Street. The wide gallery gives access to the lobby of the office building. The third building is set up by a prismatic piece on M Street, also set back to emphasize the two corners.\n\nThe cinema with a capacity for 1,700 spectators was originally a Cinerama which used three projectors and a twenty-five-foot radius screen. It had a small stage in which short-term shows could be offered, to entertain the audience in the middle of the films.\nThe radio station CMQ occupied part of the offices of the ten-story building, which was attached to the block of rental offices. In this area, a part of the land had also been reserved for future television installations, which had not yet been built. In one of its studios, Studio Number 2 was the venue not only of radio program transmissions but also that studio was the location of all or most of the RCA Victor recordings in Cuba from 1948 to 1959. The label at the CMQ complex was Discuba, a Cuban record label founded in 1959 by RCA Victor. It released music by several internationally successful artists such as Celia Cruz, Beny Mor\u00e9, Orquesta Arag\u00f3n and La Lupe.\nThe ground floor, which was common for the entire complex, had different types of commercial establishments: several exhibition halls, a bank, a restaurant, and a cafeteria. The pedestrian circulation was designed in such a way so that it made it necessary to pass in front of these premises.\nThe Radiocentro CMQ Building of 1947, built on 23rd Street between Calles L and M in El Vedado, was the first mixed use building in Cuba.", "start_char_idx": 51848, "end_char_idx": 55403, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60e26940-030e-4c59-ae66-3cedf4c10d1c": {"__data__": {"id_": "60e26940-030e-4c59-ae66-3cedf4c10d1c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7464ab8d-dbf8-47c9-a4dc-22efe7a3141e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9233d2bae83c09ac94bc50385d45502d164e729c6e922d18f1dee31e60546ed2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8e5138d0-2837-4576-b754-58d68501ada8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "d2c103d2e75515cc8ac5027e712302f565f5258d4e1c86ff74c77e6794fe2b1d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9cecf1e9-72d1-4927-8085-ff498fb929d9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7cfd30360788de7ef24fd7ea51db898ca7db446ebdb3d6588c01b5f26bdbcbe9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The pedestrian circulation was designed in such a way so that it made it necessary to pass in front of these premises.\nThe Radiocentro CMQ Building of 1947, built on 23rd Street between Calles L and M in El Vedado, was the first mixed use building in Cuba. The architectural program of the building included businesses, offices, radio, and television studios, as well as the Cinerama Warner cinema. This project joined the expertise of the structural engineers, the U.S. firm Purdy and Henderson, Engineers, and the architects Mart\u00edn Dom\u00ednguez Esteban and Miguel Gast\u00f3n and Emilio del Junco, all members of the ATEC (Cuban section of the CIAM). The building had a great impact since it was published in the magazine L'Architecture d'aujourd'hui.The building is a series of independent boxes, it was designed by the Basque architect Mart\u00edn Dom\u00ednguez Esteban (1897\u20131970). Esteban had been the architect of the Hip\u00f3dromo de la Zarzuela, along with Carlos Arniches.\nThe CMQ Building was loosely modeled after Raymond Hood's Rockefeller Center. The Radiocentro CMQ Building had an impact on many Cuban architects who subscribed to Modern architecture and buildings that would be built in the following years, such as the Hotel Habana Hilton across La Rampa (now known as Hotel Habana Libre) designed by Welton Becket and associates with the Cuban architectural firm of Arroyo and Men\u00e9ndez, the 1958, the twenty-three-story Edificio Seguro Medico by Antonio Quintana, among others.\n\nWalter Gropius, during a visit he made in 1949 to Havana referred to the Radiocentro CMQ Building to defend the need for architectural teamwork and collaboration among architects: It is impossible for the architect to know all of the equipment and installation requirements; therefore, it is necessary for the cooperation of architectural specialists.\n\n\n===== FOCSA Building =====\n\nThe FOCSA Building is a residential block in the Vedado neighborhood of Havana, Cuba. It was named after the contracting company Fomento de Obras y Construcciones, Sociedad An\u00f3nima, and the architects were Ernesto G\u00f3mez Sampera (1921\u20132004), Mercedes Diaz (his wife), and Mart\u00edn Dom\u00ednguez Esteban (1897\u20131970), who was the architect of the Radiocentro CMQ Building. The structural engineer was Luis S\u00e1enz Duplace, of the firm S\u00e1enz, Cancio & Mart\u00edn, and professor of engineering at the University of Havana. The civil engineers were Bartolome Bestard and Manuel Padron. Gustavo Becquer and Fernando H. Meneses were the mechanical and electrical engineers, respectively. It is located on a site bordered by Calles 17 and M and Calles 19 and N in the Vedado.\nThe Edificio Focsa (1956) represents Havana's economic dominance at the time. This 35-story complex was conceived and based on Corbusian ideas of a self-contained city within a city.

This work was praised even before its inauguration by the prestigious Professor Pedro Mart\u00ednez Incl\u00e1n on the occasion of the delivery of the First Prize to the Project where he proposed that Quintana, when he managed to carry out his project, could blazon of having endowed Havana, according to the famous sentence of Paul Valery, \"of a building that speaks\". At the national level, Quintana received the recognition of the main specialized publications that circulated in the country at that time: Architecture, Space, Cuba Album, etc.; at the same time is diffused internationally through the book Latin American Architecture since 1945, published by the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Exhibition of Modern Cuban Architecture held in the city itself by the Architectural League of New York. Almost at the end of the 50s, he receives two distinctions: in 1959 the Gold Medal Award of the National College of Architects and the condition of best commercial work of this period.\"\nToday the building houses the Cuban Ministry of Public Health and the Prensa Latina Agency.

Old Havana, with its narrow streets and overhanging balconies, is the traditional centre of part of Havana's commerce, industry, and entertainment, as well as being a residential area.\nTo the west a newer section, centred on the uptown area known as Vedado, has become the rival of Old Havana for commercial activity and nightlife. The Capitolio Nacional building marks the beginning of Centro Habana, a working-class neighborhood that lies between Vedado and Old Havana. Barrio Chino and the Real Fabrica de Tabacos Partag\u00e1s, one of Cuba's oldest cigar factories is located in the area.A third Havana is that of the more affluent residential and industrial districts that spread out mostly to the west. Among these is Marianao, one of the newer parts of the city, dating mainly from the 1920s. Some of the suburban exclusivity was lost after the revolution, many of the suburban homes having been nationalized by the Cuban government to serve as schools, hospitals, and government offices. Several private country clubs were converted to public recreational centres. Miramar, located west of Vedado along the coast, remains Havana's exclusive area; mansions, foreign embassies, diplomatic residences, upscale shops, and facilities for wealthy foreigners are common in the area. The International School of Havana is located in the Miramar neighborhood.\nIn the 1980s many parts of Old Havana, including the Plaza de Armas, became part of a projected 35-year multimillion-dollar restoration project, for Cubans to appreciate their past and boost tourism. In the past ten years, with the assistance of foreign aid and under the support of local city historian Eusebio Leal Spengler, large parts of Habana Vieja have been renovated. The city is moving forward with their renovations, with most of the major plazas (Plaza Vieja, Plaza de la Catedral, Plaza de San Francisco and Plaza de Armas) and major tourist streets (Obispo and Mercaderes) near completion.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nBy the end of 2012 official Census, 19.1% of the population of Cuba lived in Havana. According to the census of 2012, the population was 2,106,146. The city has an average life expectancy of 76.81 years at birth. In 2009, there were 1,924 people living with HIV/AIDS in the city, 78.9% of these are men, and 21.1% being women.Havana agglomeration grew rapidly during the first half of the 20th century reaching 1 million inhabitants in the 1943 census. The con-urbanization expanded over the Havana municipality borders into neighbor municipalities of Marianao, Regla and Guanabacoa. Starting from the 1980s, the city's population is growing slowly as a result of balanced development policies, low birth rate, its relatively high rate of emigration abroad, and controlled domestic migration. Because of the city and country's low birth rate and high life expectancy, its age structure is similar to a developed country, with Havana having an even higher proportion of elderly than the country as a whole.", "start_char_idx": 63209, "end_char_idx": 66335, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f807c88-8b32-456d-8b81-5093d7f08728": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f807c88-8b32-456d-8b81-5093d7f08728", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7464ab8d-dbf8-47c9-a4dc-22efe7a3141e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9233d2bae83c09ac94bc50385d45502d164e729c6e922d18f1dee31e60546ed2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "209c7d7e-52a2-4099-86fa-489701799af3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "ec74c6bddbcfd39680f27aa3751e5a0352c80ea5c8fc3def61c216d98ac07ace", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ff620030-0992-4e19-a462-1905216227ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a586842a6d1d19a545926307a6e4a15212aba2a42acbaa9f809aa7c21c3cb014", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Ethnic breakdown ===\nAccording to the 2012 national census of Havana's population (the Cuban census and similar studies use the term \"skin color\" instead of \"race\").\nWhite: 58.4%, (Spanish descent were most common)\nMestizo or Mulatto (mixed race): 26.4%\nBlack: 15.2%\nAsian: 0.2%As with the other Caribbean nations, there are few mestizos in Havana (and Cuba as a whole), in contrast to many other Latin American countries, because the indigenous Ta\u00edno population was virtually wiped out by Eurasian diseases in the earliest period of the Spanish conquest.The Cuban government controls the movement of people into Havana on the grounds that the Havana metropolitan area (home to nearly 20% of the country's population) is overstretched in terms of land use, water, electricity, transportation, and other elements of the urban infrastructure. There is a population of internal migrants to Havana nicknamed \"palestinos\" (Palestinians), sometimes considered a racist term, these mostly hail from the eastern region of Oriente.The city's significant minority of Chinese, mostly Cantonese ancestors, were brought in the mid-19th century by Spanish settlers via the Philippines with work contracts and after completing 8-year contracts many Chinese immigrants settled permanently in Havana. Before the revolution the Chinese population counted to over 200,000, today, Chinese ancestors could count up to 100,000. Chinese born/ native Chinese (mostly Cantonese as well) are around 400 presently. There are some 3,000 Russians living in the city; as reported by the Russian Embassy in Havana, most are women married to Cubans who had studied in the Soviet Union. Havana also shelters other non-Cuban population of an unknown size. There is a population of several thousand North African teen and pre-teen refugees.\nBetween 2018, the most recent census, and the mid-Twentieth Century census of 1953, Havana's population has grown by an estimated 87 percent, a growth rate typical of most Latin American cities.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nRoman Catholics form the largest religious group in Havana. Havana is one of the three Metropolitan sees on the island (the others being Camag\u00fcey and Santiago), with two suffragan bishoprics: Matanzas and Pinar del R\u00edo. Its patron saint is San Crist\u00f3bal (Saint Christopher), to whom the cathedral is devoted. it also has a minor basilica, Bas\u00edlica Santuario Nacional de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Caridad del Cobre and two other national shrines, Jes\u00fas Nazareno del Rescate and San L\u00e1zaro (El Rinc\u00f3n). It received papal visits from three successive supreme pontiffs: Pope John Paul II (January 1998), Pope Benedict XVI (March 2012) and Pope Francis (September 2015).\nThe Jewish community in Havana has reduced after the Revolution from once having embraced more than 15,000 Jews, many of whom had fled Nazi persecution and subsequently left Cuba to Miami or moved to Israel after Castro took to power in 1959. The city once had five synagogues, but only three remain (one Orthodox, and two Conservative: one Conservative Ashkenazi and one Conservative Sephardic), Beth Shalom Grand Synagogue is one of them and another that is a hybrid of all 3 put together.

Sugar and a flourishing slave trade first brought riches to the city, and later, after independence, it became a renowned resort. Despite efforts by Fidel Castro's government to spread Cuba's industrial activity to all parts of the island, Havana remains the center of much of the nation's industry.The traditional sugar industry, upon which the island's economy has been based for three centuries, is centered elsewhere on the island and controls some three-fourths of the export economy. But light manufacturing facilities, meat-packing plants, and chemical and pharmaceutical operations are concentrated in Havana. Other food-processing industries are also important, along with shipbuilding, vehicle manufacturing, production of alcoholic beverages (particularly rum), textiles, and tobacco products, particularly the world-famous Habanos cigars. Although the harbors of Cienfuegos and Matanzas, in particular, have been developed under the revolutionary government, Havana remains Cuba's primary port facility; 50% of Cuban imports and exports pass through Havana. The port also supports a considerable fishing industry.In 2000, nearly 89% of the city's officially recorded labor force worked for government-run agencies, institutions or enterprises. Havana, on average, has the country's highest incomes and human development indicators. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba re-emphasized tourism as a major industry leading to its recovery. Tourism is now Havana and Cuba's primary economic source.Havana's economy is still in flux, despite Raul Castro's embrace of free enterprise in 2011. Though there was an uptick in small businesses in 2011, many have since gone out of business, due to lack of business and income on the part of the local residents, whose salaries average $20 per month.\n\n\n=== Commerce and finance ===\nAfter the Revolution, Cuba's traditional capitalist free-enterprise system was replaced by a heavily socialized economic system. In Havana, Cuban-owned businesses and U.S.-owned businesses were nationalized and today most businesses operate solely under state control.In Old Havana and throughout Vedado there are several small private businesses, such as shoe-repair shops or dressmaking facilities. Banking as well is also under state control, and the National Bank of Cuba, headquartered in Havana, is the control center of the Cuban economy. Its branches in some cases occupy buildings that were in pre-revolutionary times the offices of Cuban or foreign banks.In the late 1990s Vedado, located along the atlantic waterfront, started to represent the principal commercial area. It was developed extensively between 1930 and 1960, when Havana developed as a major destination for U.S. tourists; high-rise hotels, casinos, restaurants, and upscale commercial establishments, many reflecting the art deco style.Vedado is today Havana's financial district, the main banks, airline companies offices, shops, most businesses headquarters, numerous high-rise apartments and hotels, are located in the area. The University of Havana is located in Vedado.", "start_char_idx": 69674, "end_char_idx": 73102, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd9a7660-fd83-4a45-8fe2-144c7084d227": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd9a7660-fd83-4a45-8fe2-144c7084d227", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7464ab8d-dbf8-47c9-a4dc-22efe7a3141e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9233d2bae83c09ac94bc50385d45502d164e729c6e922d18f1dee31e60546ed2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff620030-0992-4e19-a462-1905216227ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "12f5b751ed7e1dbb9fb3a8a23f2ee181977e837cdf02ca6eea89afab5ea9d40a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "82409fbc-9cf2-4238-b449-319b5b9ebe46", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e5d1e0747e1e5a511dbfb2d4ee350750e0342b729d8be7b3a333b654c8906dea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Tourism ===\nThe city has long been a popular attraction for tourists. Between 1915 and 1930, Havana hosted more tourists than any other location in the Caribbean. The influx was due in large part to Cuba's proximity to the United States, where restrictive prohibition on alcohol and other pastimes stood in stark contrast to the island's traditionally relaxed attitude to leisure pursuits. A pamphlet published by E.C. Kropp Co., Milwaukee, WI, between 1921 and 1939 promoting tourism in Havana, Cuba, can be found in the University of Houston Digital Library, Havana, Cuba, The Summer Land of the World, Digital Collection.With the deterioration of Cuba \u2013 United States relations and the imposition of the trade embargo on the island in 1961, tourism dropped drastically and did not return to anything close to its pre-revolution levels until 1989. The revolutionary government in general, and Fidel Castro in particular, opposed any considerable development of tourism. In 1982, the Cuban government passed a foreign investment code which opened a number of sectors to foreign capital.Through the creation of firms open to such foreign investment (such as Cubanacan), Cuba began to attract capital for hotel development, managing to increase the number of tourists from 130,000 (in 1980) to 326,000 (by the end of that decade).Havana has also been a popular health tourism destination for more than 20 years. Foreign patients travel to Cuba, Havana in particular, for a wide range of treatments including eye-surgery, neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, and orthopedics. Many patients are from Latin America, although medical treatment for retinitis pigmentosa, often known as night blindness, has attracted many patients from Europe and North America.\nHavana attracts over a million tourists annually, the Official Census for Havana reports that in 2010 the city was visited by 1,176,627 international tourists, a 20% increase from 2005.", "start_char_idx": 73105, "end_char_idx": 75088, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82409fbc-9cf2-4238-b449-319b5b9ebe46": {"__data__": {"id_": "82409fbc-9cf2-4238-b449-319b5b9ebe46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7464ab8d-dbf8-47c9-a4dc-22efe7a3141e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9233d2bae83c09ac94bc50385d45502d164e729c6e922d18f1dee31e60546ed2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd9a7660-fd83-4a45-8fe2-144c7084d227", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "6d337b71b2e7f0bf550287b7edf62a01bbac0adc558abda2ca6c40a32586b73d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3ca4cf9d-08b3-4db8-8792-99b41cb2455b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4969d8483b07177df062a9becab03a32e3c236761031f0db2c928789284a3536", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Poverty and slums ===\nThe years after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the city, and Cuba in general have suffered decades of economic deterioration, including Special Period of the 1990s. The national government does not have an official definition of poverty. The government researchers argue that \"poverty\" in most commonly accepted meanings does not really exist in Cuba, but rather that there is a sector of the population that can be described as \"at risk\" or \"vulnerable\" using internationally accepted measures.The generic term \"slum\" is seldom used in Cuba, substandard housing is described: housing type, housing conditions, building materials, and settlement type. The National Housing Institute considers units in solares (a large inner-city mansion or older hotel or boarding house subdivided into rooms, sometimes with over 60 families) and shanty towns to be the \"precarious housing stock\" and tracks their number. Most slum units are concentrated in the inner-city municipalities of Old Havana and Centro Habana, as well as such neighborhoods as Atar\u00e9s in Regla. People living in slums have access to the same education, health care, job opportunities and social security as those who live in formerly privileged neighborhoods. Shanty towns are scattered throughout the city except for in a few central areas.Over 9% of Havana's population live in cuarter\u00eda (solares, ciudadela), 3.3% in shanty towns, and 0.3% in refugee shelters. This does not include an estimate of the number of people living in housing in \"fair\" or \"poor\" condition because in many cases these units do not necessarily constitute slum housing but rather are basically sound dwellings needing repairs. According to Instituto Nacional de Vivienda (National Housing Institute) official figures, in 2001, 64% of Havana's 586,768 units were considered in \"good\" condition, up from 50% in 1990. Some 20% were in \"fair\" condition and 16% in \"poor\" condition. Partial or total building collapses are not uncommon, although the number had been cut in half by the end of the 1990s as the worst units disappeared and others were repaired. Buildings in Old Havana and Centro Habana are especially exposed to the elements: high humidity, the corrosive effects of salt spray from proximity to the coast, and occasional flooding. Most areas of the city, especially the highly populated districts, are in urban decay.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nHavana is served by Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport. The Airport lies about 11 kilometers (7 mi) south of the city center, in the municipality of Boyeros, and is the main hub for the country's flag carrier Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n. The airport is Cuba's main international and domestic gateway, it connects Havana with the rest of the Caribbean, North, Central and South America, Europe and one destination in Africa.\nThe city is also served by Playa Baracoa Airport which is small airport to the west of city used for some domestic flights, primarily Aerogaviota.", "start_char_idx": 75091, "end_char_idx": 78084, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ca4cf9d-08b3-4db8-8792-99b41cb2455b": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ca4cf9d-08b3-4db8-8792-99b41cb2455b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7464ab8d-dbf8-47c9-a4dc-22efe7a3141e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9233d2bae83c09ac94bc50385d45502d164e729c6e922d18f1dee31e60546ed2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "82409fbc-9cf2-4238-b449-319b5b9ebe46", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "1df30578e579e350ecfe114843d7d2d146642f4726836c88fdecb4c21d126b0c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "57cf1eb5-ba37-4b4e-b412-37e19222566b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3b484ef7f57f76db985abf01b9acecd91db17d515f6ac2435a6f8b23638816d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Rail ===\nHavana has a network of suburban, interurban and long-distance rail lines. The railways are nationalized and run by the FFCC (Ferrocarriles de Cuba \u2013 Railways of Cuba). The FFCC connects Havana with all the provinces of Cuba, and the Havana Suburban Railway serves the city. The main railway stations are: Central Rail Station, La Coubre Rail Station, Casablanca Station, and Estaci\u00f3n de Tulip\u00e1n.\nIn 2004 the annual passenger volume was some 11 million, but demand is estimated at two-and-a-half to three times this value, with the busiest route being between Havana and Santiago de Cuba, some 836 kilometers (519 mi) apart by rail.

New Chinese made and Russian made coaches for distance trains debuted in the 2010s, and some now serve suburban services.\nIn the 1980s there were plans for a Metro system in Havana similar to Moscow's, as a result of the Soviet Union influence in Cuba at the time. The studies of geology and finance made by Cuban, Czech and Soviet specialists were already well advanced in the 1980s. The Cuban press showed the construction project and the course route, linking municipalities and neighborhoods in the capital.

The city was built in baroque and neoclassical styles. Many buildings have fallen into ruin in the latter half of the 20th century, but a number are being restored. The narrow streets of Old Havana contain many buildings, accounting for perhaps as many as one-third of the approximately 3,000 buildings found in Old Havana. It is the ancient city formed from the port, the official center, and the Plaza de Armas.Old Havana resembles Cadiz and Tenerife. Alejo Carpentier called it \"de las columnas\" (of the columns), but it could also be named for the gateways, the revoco, the deterioration and the rescue, the intimacy, the shade, the cool, the courtyards. There are all the big ancient monuments, the forts, the convents and churches, the palaces, the alleys, the arcade. The Cuban State had undertaken enormous efforts to preserve and restore Old Havana through the efforts of the Office of the Historian of the city, which was directed by Eusebio Leal.Old Havana and its fortifications were added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1982.\n\n\n=== Royal Shipyard ===\n\n The Royal Arsenal was located southeast of the Campo de Marte, immediately outside the southernmost gate of the city in the area presently occupied by Havana Central railway station. The surface of the Royal Arsenal of Havana formed a kind of quadrilateral, which occupied approximately nine hectares. Of this great extension, about three hectares was vacant land, for the most part unhealthy, low-lying and marshy; another five hectares were dedicated fundamentally to deposits of materials, barracks, and warehouses; Of these, some two or three hectares were used for shipbuilding and ship repair activities, and it was where the main facilities were located: davits, cranes, parapets, docks, transport pits, the largest of which had almost a hundred fifty meters at the end of the 18th century; it also had a hospital of fateful fame for the high incidence of deaths due to yellow fever among patients who were admitted there for other causes. On the south side of the Arsenal, some five hundred meters of coastline formed a small inlet of almost a hectare in area, with low bottoms, which allowed the constructed ships to be launched smoothly.", "start_char_idx": 84519, "end_char_idx": 87591, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9814e2b5-625c-41d7-addd-fd587d81a55f": {"__data__": {"id_": "9814e2b5-625c-41d7-addd-fd587d81a55f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7464ab8d-dbf8-47c9-a4dc-22efe7a3141e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9233d2bae83c09ac94bc50385d45502d164e729c6e922d18f1dee31e60546ed2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3871b110-4a85-4915-befd-92c7bddd7271", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "00b71947ae6d53cd091e0b99f89259b88d2d4e4a5cbfa7d447057004d4bcc0c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "03b551f2-dd9d-44ec-890b-1f85cf73dc28", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4e29c42d542f33d3cae3ae12d2a9e6be4f0afadd2189d8db159d8cb0bb13158d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== La Alameda de Paula ===\n\nThe Alameda de Paula is a promenade in Havana, Cuba, and was the first to be built in the city.\nThe Alameda de Paula was commissioned by Captain General (Spanish: Capitan\u00eda General de Cuba) Felipe de Fons de Viela, member of the court of King Carlos III.

Avenida de Carlos III begins at the intersection with the Ayestar\u00e1n and Presidente Menocal or Calle Infanta.The beautification plan of Havana by the engineer Mariano Carrillo de Albornoz during the third decade of the nineteenth century, contemplated the construction of s comfortable and beautiful walk that would serve for the recreation of the city's residents who were already spreading to more and more of its original city limits and as framed by the original wall that protected them from foreign attacks.The Paseo de Tac\u00f3n would allow for better communication with the Spanish troops in the Castillo del Pr\u00edncipe, because until then it was difficult to reach that military installation by having to circumvent a low and muddy road that became practically impassable in times of rains.Tacon said about this project:\n\n\"It lacked the capital of a country walk where you could breathe the pure and free air, and I resolved to undertake it from the field that they call from Pe\u00f1alver to the hillside where the Prince's castle is located. It was this site, once swampy and watery, the most on purpose for a work of this kind in the surroundings of this city, in the part where it is not surrounded by the sea.

The mills were owned by Mart\u00edn de Ar\u00f3stegui, president of the Royal Tobacco Factory belonging to the Spanish king, hence its name. This name appeared in the National Archive of Cuba in 1850 and has been maintained to this day. Before 1850 it was known as the Tac\u00f3n Garden, as it appears in a plan of 1843 and in a marble plaque, enclosed in the wall of an old building in the area.These mills operated until the second half of the 19th century, moved by the force of the water from the so-called Zanja Real, the first aqueduct that Havana had. Its construction began in 1592, and they were finished after 27 years of work. Very close to the Cathedral of Havana is the Callej\u00f3n del Chorro, whose name comes from its old use. Originally the cathedral was called Plaza de la Ci\u00e9naga, since it was there where the people of Havana came to stock up on water, brought by the Zanja Real.At the end of the War of Independence in Cuba, with the defeat of Spain and in the absence of the representation of the Cuban people, the Treaty of Paris was signed on December 10. After the war was formally ended, the President of the Republic of Cuba in Arms, Bartolom\u00e9 Mas\u00f3, met the Assembly of Representatives of Santa Cruz del Sur and resigned from his position. The Assembly moved to Havana, to house number 819 on Calzada del Cerro.The more than 11 km long El Chorro, as the Zanja Real was known, started at the Almendares River and brought water to Old Havana crossing Zanja Street (bearing its name). This first aqueduct ceased its use with the development of the city. Thus the Spanish government was forced to find an alternative solution for the supply of water to Old Havana, creating in 1835, the aqueduct of Fernando VII and the Albear in 1858 which were joined in 1878.\nWhen the king's mills disappeared, the Botanical Garden of Havana was founded, along with the construction of the resthouse of the Captaincy General of Cuba. Starting in the 1820s, research and studies on plants were carried out by Felipe Poey Aloy. The Botanical Garden was transferred, from the area that currently includes the American Fraternity Park and the south of the National Capitol, where the first Botanical Garden had been founded in 1817.The herbarium of the old Botanical Garden of Havana, in which it was started, sought the development of the botanical collection. \u00c1lvaro Reinoso carried out many of his experiments, having many small plots dedicated to the cultivation of sugar cane. The University of Havana took over between 1850 and 1871, during this time it passed into the hands of the Spanish government for a period of 8 years.After this period, the Spanish government returned the land to the university establishing the School of Botany, which sharing its function with the School of Second Education.In 1906 the garden was inscribed in the World System of Botanical Gardens.

New businesses are appearing on the esplanade due to economic reforms in Cuba that now allow Cubans to own private businesses.\nConstruction of the Malec\u00f3n began in 1901, during temporary U.S. military rule. The main purpose of building the Malec\u00f3n was to protect Havana from the sea.To celebrate the construction of the first 500 m section of the Malec\u00f3n, the American government built a roundabout at the intersection of Paseo del Prado, which, according to architects of the period, was the first one built in Cuba with steel-reinforced concrete. In front of the roundabout, where every Sunday bands played Cuban melodies, the Miramar Hotel was built, which was very much in fashion for the first 15 years of independence, and which was the first one where the waiters wore tuxedos (dinner jackets) and vests (waistcoats) with gold buttons.Subsequent Cuban governments continued the extension of the first section of the Malec\u00f3n. In 1923, it reached the mouth of the Almendares River between K and L streets in Vedado, where the United States Embassy was built, near the Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed Sports Park and, further out, the Hotel Rosita de Hornedo (today, the Sierra Maestra).In 1957 and 1958, the roadway served as the venue of the Cuban Grand Prix.\n\nIn 1901 and 1902, from the Paseo del Prado to Calle Crespo\nBetween 1902 and 1921 as far as the Monument to the Victims of the USS Maine\nBetween 1948 and 1952 to the mouth of the Almendares RiverThe Malec\u00f3n continues to be popular among Cubans.It is also a means of income for poorer families as individual fishermen cast their lures there. In addition, it is a hotspot for prostitution in Cuba by men and women.Although the houses lining the Malec\u00f3n are mostly in ruins, the Malec\u00f3n remains one of the most spectacular and popular destinations in Havana.There are a number of important monuments along the Malec\u00f3n, including those to General M\u00e1ximo Gomez, Antonio Maceo, General Calixto Garc\u00eda, and the Monument to the Victims of the USS Maine.\nAt the intersection of 23rd Street, the Malec\u00f3n marks the northeast end of the La Rampa section of 23rd Street, Vedado.\nIn the Plaza de la Dignidad is a statue of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed and in front of the Embassy of the United States, the Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed Anti-Imperialist Platform.", "start_char_idx": 96244, "end_char_idx": 99378, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c5aa2c3-39a4-4ee4-ab48-933e6109bc2a": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c5aa2c3-39a4-4ee4-ab48-933e6109bc2a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7464ab8d-dbf8-47c9-a4dc-22efe7a3141e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9233d2bae83c09ac94bc50385d45502d164e729c6e922d18f1dee31e60546ed2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0afcf64e-1e1e-43ed-b057-745a1a954c6c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "15d0ba8ae5bf32a0cfe9edf4239b7ac42bb27a18096feb373333f8981872762f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "41689c25-82f7-42eb-b05e-8545ca2e1abd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "13c52c5f63030cad4bae603dd3d9afabf86900baa69fe895853a5d61a580894e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "At the intersection of 23rd Street, the Malec\u00f3n marks the northeast end of the La Rampa section of 23rd Street, Vedado.\nIn the Plaza de la Dignidad is a statue of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed and in front of the Embassy of the United States, the Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed Anti-Imperialist Platform.\nSignificant buildings include the Castillo de la Real Fuerza, the Castillo de San Salvador de la Punta, Malec\u00f3n 17 (Las Cari\u00e1tides) and the Hotel Nacional.\nThere were several buildings, monuments, and geographical features that were a part of Barrio de San L\u00e1zaro including the Torre\u00f3n de San L\u00e1zaro, La Casa de Beneficencia, Hospital de San L\u00e1zaro, exthe Espada Cemetery, the Casa de Dementes de San Dionisio, the Quarry of San L\u00e1zaro, the Bater\u00eda de la Reina, the Santa Clara Battery, and Hill of Taganana, among others.\nThe Malec\u00f3n has served as an inspiration for several cocktail names, including the \"Malec\u00f3n cocktail\" by John Escalante that can be traced back to his 1915 Cuban cocktail guide, Manual Del Cantinero (p,23).\n\n\n=== Col\u00f3n Cemetery ===\n\nEl Cementerio de Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n, also called La Necr\u00f3polis de Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n, was founded in 1876 in the Vedado neighbourhood of Havana, Cuba to replace the Espada Cemetery in the Barrio de San L\u00e1zaro.Named for Christopher Columbus, the cemetery is noted for its many elaborately sculpted memorials. It is estimated the cemetery has more than 500 major mausoleums. Before the Espada Cemetery and the Col\u00f3n Cemetery were built, interments took place in crypts at the various churches throughout Havana, for example, at the Havana Cathedral or Church Crypts in Havana Vieja.\nThe Col\u00f3n Cemetery is one of the most important cemeteries in the world and is generally held to be one of the most important in Latin America in historical and architectural terms, second only to La Recoleta in Buenos Aires. Prior to the opening of the Col\u00f3n Cemetery, Havana's dead were laid to rest in the crypts of local churches and then, beginning in 1806, at Havana's newly opened Espada Cemetery located in the Barrio de San Lazaro and near the cove of Juan Guillen close to the San L\u00e1zaro Leper Hospital and the Casa de Beneficencia. When locals realized there would be a need for a larger space for their community for the deceased (due to a cholera outbreak in 1868), planning began for the Col\u00f3n Cemetery.The Col\u00f3n is a Catholic cemetery and has elaborate monuments, tombs and statues by 19th and 20th century artists. Plots were assigned according to social class, and soon became a means for patrician families to display their wealth and power with ever more elaborate tombs and mausoleums. The north main entrance is marked by a gateway decorated with biblical reliefs and topped by a marble sculpture by Jos\u00e9 Vilalta Saavedra: Faith, Hope and Charity. Some of the most important and elaborate tombs lie between the main gate and the Capilla Central.

The Monumento a los Bomberos (Firemen's Monument) built by Spanish sculptor Agust\u00edn Querol and architect Julio M Zapata, commemorates the twenty eight firemen who died when a hardware shop in La Habana Vieja caught fire in 1890.\n\nIn front of the main entrance, at the axes of the principal avenues Avenida Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n, Obispo Espada, and Obispo Fray Jacinto, stands the Central Chapel modelled on Il Duomo in Florence is the octagonal Capilla Central (central chapel), the Capilla del Amor (Chapel of Love), built by Juan Pedro Bar\u00f3 for his wife Catalina Laza. On every side rectangular streets lead geometrically to the cemetery's 50,000 hectares. The area of the cemetery is defined by rank and social status of the dead with distinct areas: priests, soldiers, brotherhoods, the wealthy, the poor, infants, victims of epidemics, pagans and the condemned. The best preserved and grandest tombs stand on or near the central avenues and their axes.\nWith more than 800,000 graves and 1 million interments, space in the Col\u00f3n Cemetery is currently at a premium and as such after three years remains are removed from their tombs, boxed and placed in a storage building.\nYet, for all its elegance and grandeur, the Col\u00f3n Cemetery conceals as much as it displays. Empty tombs and desecrated family chapels disfigure the stately march of family memorials even in the most prominent of the avenues, and away from the central cross-streets are in ruin. Many of these are the tombs of exiled families, whose problems with caring for their dead have been complicated by residency outside of Cuba since the Revolution of 1959.\nThe Cementerio Col\u00f3n measures 620 by 800 meters (122.5 acres). Designed by the Galician architect Calixto Arellano de Loira y Cardoso, a graduate of Madrid's Royal Academy of Arts of San Fernando, who became the Col\u00f3n's first resident when he died and before his work was completed. It was built between 1871 and 1886, on former farmland. Laid out in a grid similar to El Vedado by numbered and lettered streets it becomes an urban microcosm of the city. The cemetery contains works by some of the most distinguished Cuban artists of the 19th and 20th centuries, such as Miguel Melero, Jos\u00e9 Vilalta de Saavedra, Rene Portocarrero, Rita longa, Eugenio Batista, Max Sorges Recio, Juan Jos\u00e9 Sicre, and others.\nThe design follows the custom of laying out the plan with five crosses formed by perpendicularly intersecting streets. The two main avenues give rise to the central cross, each of the four resulting spaces, called barracks, is subdivided in turn by two other streets that intersect at right angles. Five squares are formed at the intersections, the main one of which is the Central Chapel, with an octagonal floor plan and surrounded by portals, a Loire project completed with modifications by Francisco Marcotegui.The cemetery is laid out roughly on a north\u2013south axis, parallel to the last stretch of the Almendares River, and against the street grid of Vedado. It is on the north axis, thus its main streets are on the four cardinal points of the compass.

The bronze lions were added in 1928. The Lions were commissioned by President Gerardo Machado. They were authored by French sculptor Jean Puiforcat and Cuban-born master caster Juan Comas Masique, who used the metal from decommissioned cannons to forge the lions.\nLining the boulevard are important buildings such as the Gran Teatro de La Habana, hotels (including the Hotel Sevilla), cinemas such as the Fausto, theaters, and mansions imitating styles from Madrid, Par\u00eds and Vienna. El Prado was the first paved street in Havana. When El Capitolio was built in 1929 that section of the promenade was removed.\nAt the corner of C\u00e1rcel street the car dealership Packard & Cunnigham was located, and in 1940 the radio network RHC-Cadena Azul established its studios on the Prado.\n\nJean-Claude Nicolas Forestier (January 9, 1861, in Aix-les-Bains \u2013 October 26, 1930, in Paris) was a French landscape architect, who trained with Adolphe Alphand and became conservator of the promenades of Paris. Forestier was the landscape architect of El Prado and had moved to Havana from France for five years to collaborate with architects and landscape architects on various projects throughout the city including the design of the gardens for the Capitolio. He worked on the master plan of the city with the aim to create a harmonic balance between classical forms and the tropical landscape of Havana. He embraced and connected the city's road network while accentuating prominent landmarks through a series of parks, avenues, \"paseos,\" and boulevards which 50 years later proved to be a direct contrast to the Havana Plan Piloto of Josep Lluis Sert which was influenced by CIAM planning principles. The Congr\u00e8s internationaux d'architecture moderne (CIAM), was an organization founded in 1928 and disbanded in 1959, responsible for a series of events and congresses arranged across Europe by the most prominent architects of the time, with the objective of spreading the principles of the Modern Movement focusing in all the main domains of architecture, landscape architecture, urbanism, industrial design, and many other design practices.

Hundreds of thousands of Chinese workers were brought in by Spanish settlers from Guangdong, Fujian, Hong Kong, and Macau via Manila, Philippines starting in the mid-19th century to replace or work alongside African slaves. After completing 8-year contracts, many Chinese immigrants settled permanently in Havana.\nThe first 206 Chinese-born arrived in Havana on June 3, 1847. The neighborhood was booming with Chinese restaurants, laundries, banks, pharmacies, theaters and several Chinese-language newspapers, the neighborhood comprised 44 square blocks during its prime. The heart of Barrio Chino is on el Cuchillo de Zanja (or The Zanja Canal). The strip is a pedestrian-only street adorned with many red lanterns, dancing red paper dragons and other Chinese cultural designs, there is a great number of restaurants that served a full spectrum of Chinese dishes.\nThe district has two paifang (Chinese arches), the larger one located on Calle Dragones. China donated the materials in the late 1990s. It has a well defined written welcoming sign in Chinese and Spanish. The smaller arch is located on Calle Zanja. The Cuban's Chinese boom ended when Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution seized private businesses, sending tens of thousands of business-minded Chinese fleeing, mainly to the United States.

He spent his youth in Barcelona, where he began his artistic training in the well-regarded Escola de la Llotja. He later moved to Madrid, where he received more training under Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla. He married Irene Narezo Dragon\u00e9, a painter as well, of a distinguished family and good economic position. They moved to Paris in 1916 to further Masses' career and settled there until 1946, after which he moved to Barcelona in 1946 and later died in 1949.\nBeltran Masses was renowned as a master of colour and the psychological portrait, as well as a painter of seductive images of women. Born in Cuba, where his mother's family had lived for nearly two centuries, his family returned to Spain to live in Barcelona, when he was seven years old \u2013 the painter's Spanish heritage would influence his oeuvre deeply while he sometimes referenced the tropical exoticism of Cuba in the settings for some of his subjects.

His 1915 portrait of a Spanish countess, naked but for a white mantilla, seated between two fully clothed companions (La Maja Marquesa), was publicly denounced and had to be retitled. This inspired Beltr\u00e1n's move to Paris, where he spent most of the next thirty years. Before his departure a solo exhibition of his work in Madrid in 1916 received the accolade of a visit from the Spanish King, Alfonso XIII; this was followed by further successes at the XII Venice Biennale of 1920, where an entire pavilion was dedicated to his work, and several large-scale exhibitions in Paris, New York, Palm Beach and London received enthusiastic reviews.\nSuch was his fame that in 1926 Martha Graham titled a dance at her first public performance in New York Portrait \u2013 Beltran Masses; in 1929 the temporary removal from a London exhibition of two particularly explicit paintings led to denunciations of censorship but insured an attendance of over 17,000 paying visitors in just three weeks.

This decided Beltran Masses' move to Paris, where he spent most of the next thirty years.\nBefore his departure a solo exhibition of his work in Madrid in 1916 received the accolade of a visit from the Spanish King; Alfonso XIII's support and a personal introduction by the Spanish Dowager Queen, Maria Christina of Austria to the Spanish Ambassador, gave Beltr\u00e1n immediate access to Parisian society. He leased a splendid residence near the Porte de Passy in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, where he established his studio. Here, the coarse Catalan peasants of his youthful canvases gave way to dark eyed gitanas and recumbent majas, wearing costumes that emphasised their feminine and seductive qualities. His paintings of women earned him comparisons with the poetry of Baudelaire and, indeed, he later provided the images for an illustrated edition of Les Fleurs du Mal. The contemporary viewer was struck by his use of colour and the mysterious, nocturnal world in which he set so many of his subjects, while sharply illuminating principal figures. He often painted in a darkened room, using artificial light to emphasize the contrast between bodies and their setting. He places figures against rich fabrics or, following his sojourn in Venice in 1920, in imaginary Venetian settings.\nHis work as a portraitist became an important source of revenue; European royalty, members of the Spanish, French, Italian and British aristocracy, the wives and lovers of newly rich entrepreneurs and leading actors and dancers all vied for his attention. Despite the artistic revolution led by Beltran Masses' Spanish contemporaries Pablo Picasso and Juan Gris, Beltr\u00e1n never embraced abstract cubism and futurism held no appeal for him. The realist legacy of his teacher Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla (1863\u20131923), was subsumed instead by a mystical symbolism distinctly Beltr\u00e1n-Masses's. In his use of colour and at times exaggerated drawing, Beltr\u00e1n forged an individual and radical identity which concentrated on the psychological.

He was an early member of the \"Vanguardia\" movement of artists who, beginning in the 1920s, combined European concepts of Modern art with native Primitivism to create a distinctly Cuban aesthetic.Born in Havana, at age six Victor Manuel already showed a precocious aptitude for drawing. At age 12 he enrolled in the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes \"San Alejandro\", the most prominent art school in Cuba, where he studied under the famous painter Leopoldo Roma\u00f1ach. By his mid-teens he was acting as an unofficial professor of elementary drawing.\nBy age 19 Manuel's talent started becoming evident. Nevertheless, he didn't have his first personal exhibition until 1924, at the Gallery of San Rafael in Havana, when he was 26 years old. In 1925 he traveled to France for a year of study in Paris. There, he was exposed to the various Modernist trends of the city's bustling art scene; he found particular resonance in Paul Gauguin's Primitivist style of painting. It was in Montparnasse that a group of French artists advised him to sign his paintings only as \"V\u00edctor Manuel\" (until then, he had used his entire name and surname).After returning to Cuba, Manuel's work was featured in both a solo show (Feb. 1927) and in the Exhibition of New Work group show (May 1927) at the Painters and Sculptors Association of Havana. Sponsored by Revista de Avance, a magazine which was the main voice of the Vanguardia artists, these shows are considered to be important starting points of the Cuban modern painting era. In 1929, following another period of study and travel in Europe, Manuel created his most famous painting, La Gitana Tropical (The Tropical Gipsy), popularly known as \"La Gioconda Americana\" (\"The American Mona Lisa\"), which is in the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Havana. It is considered by critics to be one of the defining pieces of Cuban Avant-garde art.In 1935, V\u00edctor Manuel began to reap awards for his work, receiving prizes in the first two exhibitions of painting and sculpture, held in 1935 and 1938 respectively, at Havana's Lyceum. He was given solo exhibitions at the University of Havana (1945), the Association of Reporters (1951), and the Lex Gallery (1959), and was the subject of a career retrospective at the national galleries in 1959. In 1964, he began a new stage in which he expressed himself through lithography, holding experimental graphic workshops in Havana's Plaza de la Catedral. He also continued exhibiting his works abroad.He died in 1969, in Havana.", "start_char_idx": 117723, "end_char_idx": 120347, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7be7b4e-0ef9-4232-8d17-31c90db19dd4": {"__data__": {"id_": "d7be7b4e-0ef9-4232-8d17-31c90db19dd4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7464ab8d-dbf8-47c9-a4dc-22efe7a3141e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9233d2bae83c09ac94bc50385d45502d164e729c6e922d18f1dee31e60546ed2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa2d2139-ddec-40f8-8943-d751f1b5a6c8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Haryana.txt", "file_name": "Haryana.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 136662, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "fb96bebfbda7b87ef037b267cca8d617a661761887c1d09a18bcad1471d011c3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cfd2442c-fce3-4040-beba-e188252e80e8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "10840cbc83d3edbaf9be92d905d52861ea3c57e92dfe3b8ef9af7741c4dc14d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "==== Wifredo Lam ====\n\nWifredo \u00d3scar de la Concepci\u00f3n Lam y Castilla (Chinese: \u6797\u98db\u9f8d; Jyutping: lam4 fei1lung4; December 8, 1902 \u2013 September 11, 1982), better known as Wifredo Lam, was a Cuban artist who sought to portray and revive the enduring Afro-Cuban spirit and culture. Inspired by and in contact with some of the most renowned artists of the 20th century, including Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, Lam melded his influences and created a unique style, which was ultimately characterized by the prominence of hybrid figures. This distinctive visual style of his also influences many artists. Though he was predominantly a painter, he also worked with sculpture, ceramics and printmaking in his later life.\nLam, like many of the most renowned artists of the 20th century, combined radical modern styles with the \"primitive\" arts of the Americas. While Diego Rivera and Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda drew inspiration from Pre-Columbian art, Lam was influenced by the Afro-Cubans of that time. He dramatically synthesized the Surrealist and Cubist strategies while incorporating the iconography and spirit of Afro-Cuban religion. For that reason, his work does not belong to any particular art movement.\nHe held the belief that society focused too much on the individual and sought to show humanity as a whole in his artwork. He painted generic figures, creating the universal. To further his goal, he often painted mask-like faces.

While Diego Rivera and Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda drew inspiration from Pre-Columbian art, Lam was influenced by the Afro-Cubans of that time. He dramatically synthesized the Surrealist and Cubist strategies while incorporating the iconography and spirit of Afro-Cuban religion. For that reason, his work does not belong to any particular art movement.He held the belief that society focused too much on the individual and sought to show humanity as a whole in his artwork. He painted generic figures, creating the universal. To further his goal, he often painted mask-like faces.

It later expanded into radio and television networks. As a radio network it was a heated competitor of the RHC-Cadena Azul network.\nThe company was founded on March 12, 1933, by Miguel Gabriel and \u00c1ngel Camb\u00f3. Ten years later, on August 1, 1943, half of it was acquired by the business group of Goar Mestre. In the beginning, it transmitted only in the capital expanding later to the rest of the country.\nPre-revolutionary Cuba was an early adopter of new technology, including TV. Cuba was the first Latin American country to have television. In December 1946 station CM-21P conducted an experimental multi-point live broadcast.\nRegular commercial broadcasting began in October 1950 with Gaspar Pumarejo's Uni\u00f3n Radio TV. This was followed by Goar Mestre Espinosa's CMQ-TV on channel 6 on December 18, 1950. CMQ officially launched on March 11, 1951, and would become an NBC affiliate. By 1954, CMQ-TV had expanded into a seven station network. With the CMQ network, Cuba the second country in the world, only after the United States, to have a national TV network.At the beginning of the 1950s with the transmission of the novel El Derecho de Nacer, by Felix B. Caignet, displaced the competing station, RHC Cadena Azul. It is with this leadership that the second Cuban television channel, CMQ TV, Channel 6 is born. It was initially located on Calle Monte, on the corner of Paseo del Prado. On March 12, 1948, the radio studio was moved to the Radiocentro building in La Rampa and Calle L in El Vedado.\n\n\n===== La Tremenda Corte =====\n\nLa Tremenda Corte was a radio comedy show produced from the Radiocentro CMQ Building in Havana, Cuba. The scripts were written by C\u00e1stor Vispo, a Spaniard who became Cuban citizen. The show was aired nonstop from 1942 to 1961. Later, the format of the show was adapted for a TV sitcom in Monterrey, Mexico, however, only three and a half seasons were produced from 1966 to 1969.\nC\u00e1stor Vispo was born in A Coru\u00f1a, Spain. He left his hometown at the age of 18, shortly after the Spanish Civil War broke out, to join his family in Cuba. While working at the El Universal newspaper, Vispo used his free time to write.

Soon they found Leopoldo Fern\u00e1ndez (Tres Patines), a talented comedian who was already recognized in radio spots and theatre, and his inseparable friend, Anibal de Mar. The duo had already achieved popularity as the comedy duo Pototo y Filomeno, and they would bring parts of their act into the new show. The rest of the cast came from tests with other less well-known comedians, but equally outstanding.\nThe program began broadcasting on radio station RHC-Cadena Azul on January 7, 1942. It was owned by Amado Trinidad Velasco since 1941 (RHC belonged to the famous cigarette company Trinidad and Brothers).\nIn 1947, \"La Tremenda Corte\" like several other programs of its time, was transferred to rival station CMQ Radio advertisers and sponsors, seeking greater competitive advantage.\nThe programs were broadcast live back then, three times per week from Monday to Friday at 8:30 pm, and were sponsored by a firm of perfumery and soaps.\n\n\n====== CMQ Radio ======\nLa Tremenda Corte aired uninterrupted from 1942 to 1961 (first RHC Cadena Azul and later at QMC), and its sole writer was Vispo. Despite such strenuous work for his imagination, Vispo always managed to pull through during this period. Over 360 shows are estimated to have been recorded, many of which are still heard on radio, but a few such episodes have never left Cuba and little is therefore known about them.\nOf all these missing radio shows were recorded at station CMQ in Havana, between 1947 and 1961, no one knows how many still survive, and they are considered rare and invaluable for fans and collectors of the series.\nIn the peak of their success, the performances of the cast were taken to countries such as Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Panama and the Dominican Republic, where they were acclaimed.\n\n\n====== TV series ======\nIn 1955 the program received a second wind, becoming the TV space comedy \"The show of Pototo & Filomeno\" CMQ through TV, where Leopoldo Fernandez (\"Pototo\") made a very similar to \"Tres Patines\" with again his teammate Anibal de Mar (Filomeno).\nThe space consisted of skits and songs with orchestral music, a forerunner of its kind on the island of Cuba. Its success prompted the couple's two music recordings and a second film (\"Ol\u00e9 Cuba!\") In 1957.

Castro's regime, with its rigid Marxist tendency in those years, showed its displeasure with the existence of comedy shows on the broadcast media, especially when political leaders started to become the butt of jokes.\n1960 and 1961 were particularly difficult for the cast, as the government began sending sympathizers to chant Communist slogans and disrupt the performances.\nThen, in 1961, the Cuban government placed all theater, radio and TV troupes under the purview of the state Censorship Commission.\nFern\u00e1ndez was arrested over a shooting in performance and had to serve a 27-day house arrest sentence for which no further explanation was offered.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\n\n==== Film Festival ====\n\nThe Havana Film Festival is a Cuban festival that focuses on the promotion of Latin American filmmakers.

Situated in the Western Himalayas, it is one of the thirteen mountain states and is characterised by an extreme landscape featuring several peaks and extensive river systems. Himachal Pradesh is the northernmost state of India and shares borders with the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh to the north, and the states of Punjab to the west, Haryana to the southwest, Uttarakhand to the southeast and a very narrow border with Uttar Pradesh to the south. The state also shares an international border to the east with the Tibet Autonomous Region in China. Himachal Pradesh is also known as Dev Bhoomi or Dev Bhumi, meaning 'Land of Gods' and Veer Bhoomi which means 'Land of the Brave'.The predominantly mountainous region comprising the present-day Himachal Pradesh has been inhabited since pre-historic times, having witnessed multiple waves of human migrations from other areas. Through its history, the region was mostly ruled by local kingdoms, some of which accepted the suzerainty of larger empires. Prior to India's independence from the British, Himachal comprised the hilly regions of the Punjab Province of British India. After independence, many of the hilly territories were organised as the Chief Commissioner's province of Himachal Pradesh, which later became a Union Territory. In 1966, hilly areas of the neighbouring Punjab state were merged into Himachal and it was ultimately granted full statehood in 1971.\nHimachal Pradesh is spread across valleys with many perennial rivers flowing through them. Agriculture, horticulture, hydropower, and tourism are important constituents of the state's economy. The hilly state is almost universally electrified, with 99.5% of households having electricity as of 2016. The state was declared India's second open-defecation-free state in 2016. According to a survey of CMS-India Corruption Study in 2017, Himachal Pradesh is India's least corrupt state.Himachal Pradesh is divided into 12 districts.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the state is a reference to its setting: Himachal means \u201csnowy slopes\u201d (Sanskrit: hima, meaning \u201csnow\u201d; acal/achal meaning \"slopes\", or \"land\", or \"abode\"). Himachal Pradesh (\u0266\u026a\u02c8ma\u02d0t\u0283\u0259l p\u027e\u0259\u02c8de\u02d0\u0283; literally \"snow-laden province\"). Himachal refers to being in the \"aanchal\" of the Himalayas hence, sheltered by the Himalayas or by the snow. It means \"the land in the lap of snowy  Himalayas\". Pradesh means \"state\". Himachal was named by Diwakar Datt Sharma, a Sanskrit scholar.\n\n\n== History ==", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2626, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99fd2e87-2bd6-4cb8-86cd-7d146e823d14": {"__data__": {"id_": "99fd2e87-2bd6-4cb8-86cd-7d146e823d14", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36974, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4cdbc249-551e-47bc-b2da-649cfad7c4cd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36974, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "eebab410e210b72872d090f8c0f11499c4503f0be0439a4b104c3266213852ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5de4d1a3-bc33-46e1-b448-6c933bf0bdfe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36974, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "aeb74554852320449cf2af0f9463bb1c87ddb7caa7a4d1ca3cee2ddd8269715d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bd68c2b0-c0fb-4ba6-9c7d-aad41c9b9dbe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9102c545ae8ac1767712a77b498e5fbed97b6dbf4830fb32ef778ccf2eef6746", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nTribes such as the Koli, Hali, Dagi, Dhaugri, Dasa, Khasa, Kanaura, and Kirata inhabited the region from the prehistoric era. The foothills of the modern state of Himachal Pradesh were inhabited by people from the Indus valley civilisation, which flourished between 2250 and 1750 BCE. The Kols and Mundas are believed to be the original inhabitants to the hills of present-day Himachal Pradesh, followed by the Bhotas and Kiratas.During the Vedic period, several small republics known as Janapada existed which were later conquered by the Gupta Empire. After a brief period of supremacy by King Harshavardhana, the region was divided into several local powers headed by chieftains, including some Rajputs principalities. These kingdoms enjoyed a large degree of independence and were invaded by Delhi Sultanate several times. Mahmud Ghaznavi conquered Kangra at the beginning of the 11th century. Timur and Sikander Lodi also marched through the lower hills of the state, captured several forts, and fought many battles. Several hill states acknowledged Mughal suzerainty and paid regular tribute to the Mughals.The Kingdom of Gorkha conquered many kingdoms and came to power in Nepal in 1768. They consolidated their military power and began to expand their territory. Gradually, the Kingdom of Nepal annexed Sirmour and Shimla. Under the leadership of Amar Singh Thapa, the Nepali army laid siege to Kangra. They managed to defeat Sansar Chand Katoch, the ruler of Kangra, in 1806 with the help of many provincial chiefs. However, the Nepali army could not capture Kangra fort which came under Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1809. After the defeat, they expanded towards the south of the state. However, Raja Ram Singh, Raja of Siba State, captured the fort of Siba from the remnants of Lahore Darbar in Samvat 1846, during the First Anglo-Sikh War.\nThey came into direct conflict with the British along the tarai belt, after which the British expelled them from the provinces of the Satluj. The British gradually emerged as the paramount power in the region. In the revolt of 1857, or first Indian war of independence, arising from several grievances against the British, the people of the hill states were not as politically active as were those in other parts of the country. They and their rulers, except Bushahr, remained more or less inactive. Some, including the rulers of Chamba, Bilaspur, Bhagal and Dhami, rendered help to the British government during the revolt.\nThe British territories came under the British Crown after Queen Victoria's proclamation of 1858. The states of Chamba, Mandi and Bilaspur made good progress in many fields during the British rule. During World War I, virtually all rulers of the hill states remained loyal and contributed to the British war effort, both in the form of men and materials. Among these were the states of Kangra, Jaswan, Datarpur, Guler, Rajgarh, Nurpur, Chamba, Suket, Mandi, and Bilaspur.", "start_char_idx": 2613, "end_char_idx": 5594, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd68c2b0-c0fb-4ba6-9c7d-aad41c9b9dbe": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd68c2b0-c0fb-4ba6-9c7d-aad41c9b9dbe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36974, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4cdbc249-551e-47bc-b2da-649cfad7c4cd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36974, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "eebab410e210b72872d090f8c0f11499c4503f0be0439a4b104c3266213852ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "99fd2e87-2bd6-4cb8-86cd-7d146e823d14", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36974, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "e87d46bd38be98f82adaca60c18c497dfb16a717998cec04c5e2d47d5631de54", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "183f8107-2ef0-4786-a39b-ca53972626e7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8c3696e67c311aeadda15fd81a1c8bfdc42249b9f7a8b1da25a61ba5b8b60b35", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Partition and post-independence ===\nAfter independence, the Chief Commissioner's Province of Himachal Pradesh was organised on 15 April 1948 as a result of the integration of 30 petty princely states (including feudal princes and zaildars) in the promontories of the western Himalayas.

Covering an area of 55,673 square kilometres (21,495 sq mi), it is a mountainous state. The Zanskar range runs in the northeastern part of the state and the great Himalayan range run through the eastern and northern parts, while the Dhauladhar and the Pir Panjal ranges of the lesser Himalayas, and their valleys, form much of the core regions. The outer Himalayas, or the Shiwalik range, form southern and western Himachal Pradesh. At 6,816 m, Reo Purgyil is the highest mountain peak in the state of Himachal Pradesh.The drainage system of Himachal is composed both of rivers and glaciers. Himalayan rivers criss-cross the entire mountain chain. Himachal Pradesh provides water to both the Indus and Ganges basins. The drainage systems of the region are the Chandra Bhaga or the Chenab, the Ravi, the Beas, the Sutlej, and the Yamuna. These rivers are perennial and are fed by snow and rainfall. They are protected by an extensive cover of natural vegetation. Four of the five Punjab rivers flow through Himachal Pradesh, three of them originating in the state. These rivers run through a maze of valleys separated by the mountain ranges of the state. The Satluj Valley is formed by the Satluj river entering the state near Shipki La, while the Spiti and Baspa Valleys are formed by the river's two major tributaries in the state. The Beas river flows though the Kullu and the Kangra Valleys, with tributary Parvati forming the Parvati Valley. The Chenab river, formed by the confluence of the Chandra and Bhaga, forms much of the northern regions of Lahaul and Pangi, and the Ravi river flows principally through Chamba. The Pabbar and Giri rivers in the southeast are part of the Yamuna basin.\nDue to extreme variation in elevation, great variation occurs in the climatic conditions of Himachal Pradesh. The climate varies from hot and humid subtropical in the southern tracts to, with more elevation, cold, alpine, and glacial in the northern and eastern mountain ranges. The state's winter capital, Dharamsala receives very heavy rainfall, while areas like Lahaul and Spiti are cold and almost rainless. Broadly, Himachal experiences three seasons: summer, winter, and rainy season. Summer lasts from mid-April until the end of June and most parts become very hot (except in the alpine zone which experiences a mild summer) with the average temperature ranging from 28 to 32 \u00b0C (82 to 90 \u00b0F). Winter lasts from late November until mid-March. Snowfall is common in alpine tracts. Pollution is affecting the climate of almost all the states of India. Due to steps taken by governments to prevent pollution, Himachal Pradesh has become the first smoke-free state in India which means cooking in the entire state is free of traditional chulhas.", "start_char_idx": 7294, "end_char_idx": 10175, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb9eaa40-dccf-4e03-9f8c-3c1901bf0563": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb9eaa40-dccf-4e03-9f8c-3c1901bf0563", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36974, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4cdbc249-551e-47bc-b2da-649cfad7c4cd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36974, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "eebab410e210b72872d090f8c0f11499c4503f0be0439a4b104c3266213852ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "183f8107-2ef0-4786-a39b-ca53972626e7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36974, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "6b7df50508d042292f916ba0fd7b79fb4841117a54a1b6d063777fa11454cb42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4ad0a96d-62bb-4a36-8fa3-9dc4e843cd78", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "454577da4fd6e61a4f2e0c56bd200b6ccd9c42b44fb9f174069dc37be8691de3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Flora and fauna ===\n\nHimachal Pradesh is one of the states that lies in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR), one of the richest reservoirs of biological diversity in the world.

Lahaul-Spiti region of the state, being a cold desert, supports unique plants of medicinal value including Ferula jaeschkeana, Hyoscyamus niger, Lancea tibetica, and Saussurea bracteata.Himachal is also said to be the fruit bowl of the country, with widespread  orchards. Meadows and pastures are also seen clinging to steep slopes. After the winter season, the hillsides and orchards bloom with wild flowers, white gladiolas, carnations, marigolds, roses, chrysanthemums, tulips and lilies are carefully cultivated. Himachal Pradesh Horticultural Produce Marketing and Processing Corporation Ltd. (HPMC) is a state body that markets fresh and processed fruits.Himachal Pradesh has around 463 bird, and Tragopan melanocephalus is the state bird of Himanchal Pradesh 77 mammalian, 44 reptile and 80 fish species.Himachal Pradesh has currently five National Parks. Great Himalayan National Park, oldest and largest National park in the state, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Pin Valley National Park, Inderkilla, Khirganga and Simbalbara are the other national Parks located in the state. The state also has 30 wildlife sanctuaries and 3 conservation reserves. The state bird of Himachal Pradesh is the Western tragopan, locally known as the jujurana. It is one of the rarest living pheasants in the world. The state animal is the snow leopard, which is even rarer to find than the jujurana.", "start_char_idx": 10204, "end_char_idx": 12372, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ad0a96d-62bb-4a36-8fa3-9dc4e843cd78": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ad0a96d-62bb-4a36-8fa3-9dc4e843cd78", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36974, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4cdbc249-551e-47bc-b2da-649cfad7c4cd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36974, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "eebab410e210b72872d090f8c0f11499c4503f0be0439a4b104c3266213852ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb9eaa40-dccf-4e03-9f8c-3c1901bf0563", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36974, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "4fc28a0623476c975ccb9e35a3659da39697d51a7e2b98ac3dd46be4191f4e65", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "697284c6-a027-472a-8625-8a3141416409", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "505330a4a7c34e5cbabbb6397dc67d8665e7eb9ed22f3db7b0a5501c6eea119e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Government ==\n\nThe Legislative Assembly of Himachal Pradesh has no pre-constitution history. The State itself is a post-independence creation. It came into being as a centrally administered territory on 15 April 1948 from the integration of thirty erstwhile princely states.Himachal Pradesh is governed through a parliamentary system of representative democracy, a feature the state shares with other Indian states. Universal suffrage is granted to residents. The legislature consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker who are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker's absence. The judiciary is composed of the Himachal Pradesh High Court and a system of lower courts.\nExecutive authority is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister, although the titular head of government is the Governor. The governor is the head of state appointed by the President of India. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the governor, and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly is unicameral with 68 Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). Terms of office run for five years, unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term. Auxiliary authorities known as panchayats, for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs.\nIn the assembly elections held in November 2022, the Indian National Congress secured an absolute majority, winning 40 of the 68 seats while the BJP won only 25 of the 68 seats.

The First Plan allocated \u20b952.7 million to Himachal Pradesh. More than 50% of this expenditure was incurred on transport and communication; while the power sector got a share of just 4.6%, though it had steadily increased to 7% by the Third Plan. Expenditure on agriculture and allied activities increased from 14.4% in the First Plan to 32% in the Third Plan, showing a progressive decline afterwards from 24% in the Fourth Plan to less than 10% in the Tenth Plan. Expenditure on energy sector was 24.2% of the total in the Tenth Plan.\nThe total GDP for 2005\u201306 was estimated at \u20b9254 billion as against \u20b9230 billion in the year 2004\u201305, showing an increase of 10.5%. The GDP for fiscal 2015\u201316 was estimated at \u20b91.110 trillion, which increased to \u20b91.247 trillion in 2016\u201317, recording growth of 6.8%. The per capita income increased from \u20b9130,067 in 2015\u201316 to \u20b9147,277 in 2016\u201317. The state government's advance estimates for fiscal 2017\u201318 stated the total GDP and per capita income as \u20b91.359 trillion and \u20b9158,462, respectively. As of 2018, Himachal is the 22nd-largest state economy in India with \u20b91.52 lakh crore (US$19 billion) in gross domestic product and has the 13th-highest per capita income (\u20b9160,000 (US$2,000)) among the states and union territories of India.Himachal Pradesh also ranks as the second-best performing state in the country on human development indicators after Kerala. One of the Indian government's key initiatives to tackle unemployment is the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA). The participation of women in the NREGA has been observed to vary across different regions of the nation. As of the year 2009\u20132010, Himachal Pradesh joined the category of high female participation, recording a 46% share of NREGS (National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme) workdays for women.

It is the main source of income and employment in Himachal. About 90% of the population in Himachal depends directly upon agriculture, which provides direct employment to 62% of total workers of state. The main cereals grown include wheat, maize, rice and barley with major cropping systems being maize-wheat, rice-wheat and maize-potato-wheat. Pulses, fruits, vegetables and oilseeds are among the other crops grown in the state. Centuries-old traditional Kuhl irrigation system is prevalent in the Kangra valley, though in recent years these Kuhls have come under threat from hydroprojects on small streams in the valley. Land husbandry initiatives such as the Mid-Himalayan Watershed Development Project, which includes the Himachal Pradesh Reforestation Project (HPRP), the world's largest clean development mechanism (CDM) undertaking, have improved agricultural yields and productivity, and raised rural household incomes.\nApple is the principal cash crop of the state grown principally in the districts of Shimla, Kinnaur, Kullu, Mandi, Chamba and some parts of Sirmaur and Lahaul-Spiti with an average annual production of five lakh tonnes and per hectare production of 8 to 10 tonnes. The apple cultivation constitute 49 per cent of the total area under fruit crops and 85% of total fruit production in the state with an estimated economy of \u20b93500 crore. Apples from Himachal are exported to other Indian states and even other countries. In 2011\u201312, the total area under apple cultivation was 104,000 hectares, increased from 90,347 hectares in 2000\u201301. According to the provisional estimates of Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, the annual apple production in Himachal for fiscal 2015\u201316 stood at 753,000 tonnes, making it India's second-largest apple-producing state after Jammu and Kashmir. The state is also among the leading producers of other fruits such as apricots, cherries, peaches, pears, plums and strawberries in India.\n\nKangra tea is grown in the Kangra valley. Tea plantation began in 1849, and production peaked in the late 19th century with the tea becoming popular across the globe. Production dipped sharply after the 1905 Kangra earthquake and continues to decline. The tea received geographical indication status in 2005.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\n\n==== Pharma hub ====\nHimachal Pradesh is renowned as Asia's pharmaceutical hub, housing a total of 652 pharmaceutical units. The state hosts a thriving \u20b940,000 crore drug manufacturing industry.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\n\nHydropower is one of the major sources of income generation for the state. The state has an abundance of hydropower resources because of the presence of various perennial rivers. Many high-capacity hydropower plants have been constructed which produce surplus electricity that is sold to other states, such as Delhi, Punjab and West Bengal. The income generated from exporting the electricity to other states is being provided as subsidy to the consumers in the state. The rich hydropower resources of Himachal have resulted in the state becoming almost universally electrified with around 94.8% houses receiving electricity as of 2001, as compared to the national average of 55.9%. Himachal's hydro-electric power production is, however, yet to be fully utilised. The identified hydroelectric potential for the state is 27,436 MW in five river basins while the hydroelectric capacity in 2016 was 10,351 MW.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nTourism in Himachal Pradesh is a major contributor to the state's economy and growth.", "start_char_idx": 16632, "end_char_idx": 20222, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7e36c4e-1dd5-404a-b0c6-09636cdb79e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "d7e36c4e-1dd5-404a-b0c6-09636cdb79e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36974, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4cdbc249-551e-47bc-b2da-649cfad7c4cd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36974, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "eebab410e210b72872d090f8c0f11499c4503f0be0439a4b104c3266213852ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e69f6078-50e0-4b99-8b2c-36678a68c857", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36974, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "8d49b4f975b29c23de34732a7b427061ec0a4de671d089f8eb13e287f3d17553", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6799c9a4-d6ad-47dd-918e-59dd675dc566", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a9c0c579dcadce2bd81d6759c5cdc0e29704a8c480b02f61f8501ce5e62afca6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Tourism ==\n\nTourism in Himachal Pradesh is a major contributor to the state's economy and growth.

With remarkable economic and social advancements, the state has changed rapidly. Himachal Pradesh is a multilingual state like other Indian states. Western Pahari languages also known as Himachali languages are widely spoken in the state. Some of the most commonly spoken Pahadi lects are Kangri, Mandyali, Kulvi, Chambeali, Bharmauri and Kinnauri.\n\nHimachal is well known for its handicrafts. The carpets, leather works, Kullu shawls, Kangra paintings, Chamba Rumals, stoles, embroidered grass footwear (Pullan chappal), silver jewellery, metal ware, knitted woolen socks, Pattoo, basketry of cane and bamboo (Wicker and Rattan) and woodwork are among the notable ones. Of late, the demand for these handicrafts has increased within and outside the country.Himachali caps of various colour bands are also well-known local art work, and are often treated as a symbol of the Himachali identity. The colour of the Himachali caps has been an indicator of political loyalties in the hill state for a long period of time with Congress party leaders like Virbhadra Singh donning caps with green band and the rival BJP leader Prem Kumar Dhumal wearing a cap with maroon band. The former has served six terms as the Chief Minister of the state while the latter is a two-time Chief Minister. Local music and dance also reflect the cultural identity of the state. Through their dance and music, the Himachali people entreat their gods during local festivals and other special occasions.\n\nThere are national and regional fairs and festivals, including temple fairs in nearly every region. The Kullu Dussehra, Minjar mela and Mahashivratri Mandi festival is nationally known. The day-to-day cuisine of Himachalis is similar to the rest of northern India with Punjabi and Tibetan influences. Lentils (D\u0101l), rice (ch\u0101wal or bh\u0101\u021b), vegetables (sabz\u012b) and chapati (wheat flatbread) form the staple food of the local population. Non-vegetarian food is more widely accepted in Himachal Pradesh than elsewhere in India, partly due to the scarcity of fresh vegetables on the hilly terrain of the state.Himachali specialities include Siddu, Babru, Khatta, Mhanee, Channa Madra, Patrode,  Mah ki dal, Chamba-style fried fish, Kullu trout, Chha Gosht, Pahadi Chicken, Sepu Badi, Auriya Kaddu, Aloo palda, Pateer, Makki di roti, Sarson ka saag, Chamba Chukh (Chouck), Bhagjery, Chutney of Til, etc.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===", "start_char_idx": 30184, "end_char_idx": 32736, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1729e9f-0cd5-40bd-a78e-f327d5c1c8d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1729e9f-0cd5-40bd-a78e-f327d5c1c8d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36974, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4cdbc249-551e-47bc-b2da-649cfad7c4cd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36974, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "eebab410e210b72872d090f8c0f11499c4503f0be0439a4b104c3266213852ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "618cc219-ff97-406e-b9bb-5686db49f117", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Himachal_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36974, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "b8e9de5ae63ed0e5535479df3620434dee270c0139b4de639f5b2f4218e5047c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "650e1a77-75ab-4ec8-9ef2-d10995ad4355", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c3300d7ba5d8b44e5500e7a7aeb655a9812be03d48e9cf88ff2b0917efc4d755", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Notable people ===\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nAt the time of Independence, Himachal Pradesh had a literacy rate of 8% \u2013 one of the lowest in the country. By 2011, the literacy rate surged to 82.8%, making Himachal one of the most-literate states in the country. There are over 10,000 primary schools, 1,000 secondary schools and more than 1,300 high schools in the state. In meeting the constitutional obligation to make primary education compulsory, Himachal became the first state in India to make elementary education accessible to every child. Himachal Pradesh is an exception to the nationwide gender bias in education levels. The state has a female literacy rate of around 76%. In addition, school enrolment and participation rates for girls are almost universal at the primary level. While higher levels of education do reflect a gender-based disparity, Himachal is still significantly ahead of other states at bridging the gap. The Hamirpur District in particular stands out for high literacy rates across all metrics of measurement.The state government has played an instrumental role in the rise of literacy in the state by spending a significant proportion of the state's GDP on education. During the first six five-year plans, most of the development expenditure in the education sector was utilised in quantitative expansion, but after the seventh five-year-plan the state government switched emphasis on qualitative improvement and modernisation of education. To raise the number of the teaching staff at primary schools they appointed over 1000 teacher aids through the Vidya Upasak Yojna in 2001. The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan is another HP government initiative that not only aims for universal elementary education but also encourages communities to engage in the management of schools. The Rashtriya Madhayamic Shiksha Abhiyan launched in 2009, is a similar scheme but focuses on improving access to quality secondary education.\nThe standard of education in the state has reached a considerably high level as compared to other states in India with several reputed educational institutes for higher studies. The Baddi University of Emerging Sciences and Technologies, Indian Institute of Technology Mandi, Indian Institute of Management Sirmaur, Himachal Pradesh University in Shimla, Central University of Himachal Pradesh, Dharamsala, National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur, Indian Institute of Information Technology Una, Alakh Prakash Goyal University, Maharaja Agrasen University, Himachal Pradesh National Law University are some of the notable universities in the state. Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital in Shimla, Dr. Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College in Kangra, Rajiv Gandhi Government Post Graduate Ayurvedic College in Paprola and Homoeopathic Medical College & Hospital in Kumarhatti are the prominent medical institutes in the state. Besides these, there is a Government Dental College in Shimla which is the state's first recognised dental institute.The state government has also decided to start three major nursing colleges to develop the healthcare system of the state. CSK Himachal Pradesh Krishi Vishwavidyalya Palampur is one of the most renowned hill agriculture institutes in the world. Dr. Yashwant Singh Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry has earned a unique distinction in India for imparting teaching, research and extension education in horticulture, forestry and allied disciplines. Further, state-run Jawaharlal Nehru Government Engineering College was inaugurated in 2006 at Sundernagar.\nHimachal Pradesh also hosts a campus of the fashion college, National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) in Kangra.\n\n\n== State profile ==\nSource: Department of Information and Public Relations.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOutline of Himachal Pradesh\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further

a dispute between India and Pakistan since 1947 and between India and China since 1959. The Line of Control separates Jammu and Kashmir from the Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan in the west and north. It lies to the north of the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab and to the west of Ladakh which is administered by India as a union territory.Provisions for the formation of the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir were contained within the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, which was passed by both houses of the Parliament of India in August 2019. The act re-constituted the former state of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories, one being Jammu and Kashmir and the other being Ladakh, with effect from 31 October 2019.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\nJammu and Kashmir is named after the two regions it encompasses \u2013 the Jammu region and the Kashmir Valley. As per Government of India, Kashmir region encompasses the region under Indian control and the territory under Pakistan control known as \"Pakistan-occupied Kashmir\" (POK). While Pakistan considers the Indian controlled territory as a part of \"Indian-occupied Kashmir\" (IOK) or \"Indian-held Kashmir\" (IHK), neutral sources use \"Indian-administered Kashmir\"/\"Pakistan-administered Kashmir\" and \"Indian-controlled Kashmir\"/\"Pakistan-controlled Kashmir\" to demarcate the areas.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe state of Jammu and Kashmir was accorded special status by Article 370 of the Constitution of India. In contrast to other states of India, Jammu and Kashmir had its own constitution, flag, and administrative autonomy. Indian citizens from other states were not allowed to purchase land or property in Jammu and Kashmir.Jammu and Kashmir had three distinct areas: Hindu-majority Jammu region, Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, and Buddhist-dominated Ladakh. Unrest and violence persisted in the Kashmiri Valley and, following a disputed state election in 1987, an insurgency persisted in protest over autonomy and rights.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in the 2014 Indian general election and five years later included in their 2019 election manifesto the revocation of Article 370 of the Constitution of India, in order to bring Jammu and Kashmir to equal status with other states.A resolution to repeal Article 370 was passed by both the houses of the Parliament of India in August 2019. At the same time, a reorganisation act was also passed, which would reconstitute the state into two union territories, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. The reorganisation took effect from 31 October 2019.In September 2019, nearly 4,000 people, including two former Chief Ministers and hundreds of other politicians, were arrested by the Indian authorities in Kashmir; the state was put under a lockdown and communication and internet services were suspended.\n\n\n== Geography ==", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3054, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e29b09ec-80cd-4410-a6e6-24e00060668d": {"__data__": {"id_": "e29b09ec-80cd-4410-a6e6-24e00060668d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory).txt", "file_name": "Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19706, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1ddc6559-66e0-404d-958d-30e07f82dc52", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory).txt", "file_name": "Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19706, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9fd6ad2005b156827097836862c860740eb891f70cede17fe98a3ac684dff9e2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "80c84fc6-b4fe-49ee-af1b-164be54f9757", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory).txt", "file_name": "Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19706, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "f76180e2e7ec3f07ccba19ee5eb36521d7f0565d34991659f8ec827a5b9dc6a3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6f963aa0-da9b-4d5a-9259-d7305868edbf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6dfd8d93ceb5aba603b5f02b062d206f4b5c1f6367604e67126e58edbfad45ef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nJammu and Kashmir is home to several valleys such as the Kashmir Valley, Tawi Valley, Chenab Valley, Poonch Valley, Sind Valley, and Lidder Valley. The Kashmir valley is 100 km (62 mi) wide and 15,520.3 km2 (5,992.4 sq mi) in area. The Himalayas divide the Kashmir valley from the Tibetan plateau while the Pir Panjal range, which encloses the valley from the west and the south, separates it from the Punjab Plain of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Along the northeastern flank of the Valley runs the main range of the Himalayas. This valley has an average height of 1,850 metres (6,070 ft) above sea-level, but the surrounding Pir Panjal range has an average elevation of 10,000 feet (3,000 m). The Jhelum River is the major Himalayan river which flows through the Kashmir valley. The southern Jammu region is mostly mountainous, with the Shivaliks, the middle and the great Himalayas running parallel to each other in a southeast\u2013northwest direction. A narrow southwestern strip constitutes fertile plains. The Chenab, Tawi and Ravi are important rivers flowing through the Jammu region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Jammu and Kashmir varies with altitude and across regions. Southern and southwestern areas have a sub tropical climate, with hot summers and cool winters. This region receives most of its rainfall during the monsoon season. In the east and north, summers are usually pleasant. The effect of the monsoon diminishes in areas lying to the leeward side of the Pir Panjal, such as the Kashmir valley, and much of the rainfall happens in the spring season due to western disturbances. Winters are cold, with temperatures reaching sub-zero levels. Snowfall is common in the valley and the mountain areas.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nThe union territory of Jammu and Kashmir consists of two divisions: Jammu Division and Kashmir Division, and is further divided into 20 districts.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\nJammu and Kashmir has two major airports at the two capitals of the territory: Jammu Airport at Jammu and Srinagar Airport at Srinagar, which is also the only international airport in the territory. These airports have regular flights to Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chandigarh and other major cities of the country.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nThe under-construction Jammu-Baramulla line of the Northern Railways is the only railway line in the territory. Once complete, the line will connect the two regions of Jammu and Kashmir and will also provide a rail link to the Kashmir valley from other parts of the country.\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThe Jammu-Srinagar National Highway, a segment of the NH44, is the main highway in the territory connecting the two capitals by road. National Highways 1, 144, 144A, 444, 501, 701 and 701A are the other NHs in the territory.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs per the 2011 census, Jammu and Kashmir has a total population of 12,267,013. The sex ratio is 889 females per 1000 males. Around 924,485 (7.54%) of the population is scheduled caste and 1,275,106 (10.39%) belong to the scheduled tribes, mainly Gujjar, Bakerwal, and Gaddi. The SCs are mostly concentrated in the Jammu region.

Shias are mostly concentrated in the Budgam district, where they form about 30-40% of the population.The Jammu Division is predominantly Hindu (66%) with a significant Muslim population (30%). The Muslims form a majority in the Rajouri (63%), Poonch (90%), Doda (54%), Kishtwar (58%) and Ramban (71%) districts of Jammu, while the Hindus form a majority in Kathua (88%), Samba (86%), Jammu (84%) and Udhampur (88%) districts. Reasi district has an almost equal number of Hindus and Muslims. The Dogras and various organisations of Hindu-majority Jammu region have demanded a separate state after bifurcation of the territory, on the basis of cultural, linguistic and religious differences from neighbouring Kashmiris (who are predominantly Muslim by faith).\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nKashmiri is the most-spoken language, is mainly spoken in the Kashmir Valley and in the upper reaches of the Chenab Valley, with a sizeable number of speakers in Jammu City. Dogri, related to Punjabi and Pahari, is spoken throughout the plains areas of Jammu division, as well as in parts of the hills. The hill people speak several languages.

Jharkhand is primarily rural, with about 24% of its population living in cities. It is amongst the leading states in terms of economic growth. In 2017\u201318, the GDP growth rate of state was at 10.22%.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word \"Jhar\" means 'forest' and \"Khand\" means 'land' in various Indo-Aryan languages. Thus \"Jharkhand\" means forest land.In the ancient period, in the Mahabharata, the region was referred as Kark Khand due to location near Kark Rekha, that is, Tropic of Cancer. During the Medieval period, the region was known as Jharkhand. According to Bhavishya Purana (1200 CE), Jharkhand was one of the seven Pundra desa. The name is first found on a 13th-century copper plate in Kendrapada, Odisha region from the reign of Narasimha Deva II of Eastern Ganga dynasty. Forest land from Baidhnath dham to Puri was known as Jharkhand. In Akbarnama, from Panchet in the east to Ratanpur to west, Rohtasgarh to the north and the frontier of Odisha to the south was known as Jharkhand.\n\n\n== History ==", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1840, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69c5e17e-12a5-4f14-887c-644e100825ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "69c5e17e-12a5-4f14-887c-644e100825ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Jharkhand.txt", "file_name": "Jharkhand.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 44025, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "595bdffe-5d86-45fc-ac1a-fdd2ec7d1f0d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Jharkhand.txt", "file_name": "Jharkhand.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 44025, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "91522f4e65ae81e9fff46b312455c2f782b42d76605ce8db44648263cdddfd3f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "93fce278-2124-4f1f-82c2-c319e78551e7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Jharkhand.txt", "file_name": "Jharkhand.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 44025, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "a79d56694b89753b55028c492fe6b5e6acbcb444e75f508ca5b84c02bf2e4794", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c63bd630-f867-4d30-90d4-d637d8e30e98", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e58828a95d234a1f7a8efe2a5279e9fcbfefbb51b5ab0ffc43f1c55b29992a0a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient period ===\nThe region has been inhabited since the Mesolithic-Chalcolithic period, as shown by several ancient cave paintings. \nStone tools have been discovered from Chota Nagpur Plateau region which are from the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods. There are ancient cave paintings in Isko, Hazaribagh district which are from Meso-chalcolithic period (9000\u20135000 BCE). During 2nd millennium BCE the use of Copper tools spread in Chota Nagpur Plateau and these find complexes are known as the Copper Hoard Culture. In the Kabra-Kala mound at the confluence of the Son and North Koel rivers in Palamu district various antiquities and art objects have been found which are from the Neolithic to the medieval period and pot-sherds of Redware, black and red ware, black ware, black slipped ware and NBP ware are from Chalcolithic to the late medieval period. Several iron slags, microliths, and potsherds have been discovered from Singhbhum district that are from 1400 BCE according to carbon dating age. The region was ruled by many empires and dynasties including Nanda, Maurya and Gupta during ancient period.\nIn the Mahabharata, the region was referred as Kark Khand due to its location near Tropic of Cancer. During the age of Mahajanpadas around 500 BCE, Jharkhand state was a part of Magadha and Anga. In the Mauryan period, this region was ruled by a number of states, which were collectively known as the Atavika (forest) states. These states were subdued and were forced to accept the hegemony of the Maurya empire during Ashoka's reign (c.\u2009232 BCE). In the ancient site of Saridkel, burnt brick houses, red ware pottery, copper tools, coins and iron tools have been found which belong to the early centuries CE. Brahmi inscriptions have been found in Khunti district which are from the 3rd century BCE. Samudragupta, while marching through the present-day Chotanagpur region (North and South), directed the first attack against the kingdom of Dakshina Kosala in the Mahanadi valley.\n\n\n=== Medieval period ===\nIn the 7th century, the Chinese traveller Xuanzang passed through the region. He described the kingdom as Karnasuvarna, with Shashanka as its ruler. To the north of Karn-Suberna was Magadha, Champa was in the east, Mahendra in the west, and Orissa in the south.During the medieval period, the region was governed by Nagvanshi, Pala, Khayaravala, Ramgarh Raj and Chero rulers. A Buddhist monastery has been found in Hazaribagh which was built during the Pala period in the 10th century. Bhim Karn was a Nagvanshi king during medieval period. He defeated the Raksel dynasty of Surguja when they invaded the region with cavalry.\n\n\n=== Modern period ===\nMughal influence reached Palamu during the reign of Emperor Akbar when it was conquered by Rajput Raja Mansingh in 1574. Several invasions took place during Mughal rule. During the reign of the Nagvanshi King Madhu Singh, Akbar's general invaded Khukhra. Also there was an invasion during the reign of Durjan Shah.King Ram Shah ruled Navratangarh from 1640 to 1663. He built the Kapilnath Temple in 1643.

The Kharagdiha Rajas were settled as Rajas of Raj Dhanwar in 1809, and the Kharagdiha gadis were separately settled as zamindari estates. Some of the notable Kharagdiha Zamindari estates were Koderma, Gadi Palganj and Ledo Gadi. The princely states in the Chota Nagpur Plateau came within the sphere of influence of the Maratha Empire, but they became tributary states of British East India Company as a result of the Anglo-Maratha Wars and became known as Chota Nagpur Tributary States.Subjugation, colonisation and imposition of taxes by the British East India Company resulted in spontaneous resistance from the local people. Chuar Rebellion, the first revolt against the British East India Company led by Jagannath Singh Patar in 1767 with the Bhumij tribals. The Bhumijes again revolted in 1769\u201371, led by their Sardar Ghatwals in Dhalbhum. In 1769, Raghunath Mahato also revolted against the British East India Company (EIC).In 1771, the revolt against the landlords and the British government was led by Tilka Majhi, a Paharia leader in Rajmahal Hills. Soon after in 1779, the Bhumij tribes again rose in arms against the British rule in Manbhum, called the Chuar Rebellion. In 1807, the Oraons in Barway murdered their landlord from Srinagar. The Munda tribe rose in revolt in 1811 and 1813. Bakhtar Say and Mundal Singh, two landowners, fought against the British East India Company in 1812.The Hos in Singhbhum revolted in 1820 and a Kol revolt occurred in 1832. Also in 1832 the Bhumijs revolted again against the British, this time under the leadership of Ganga Narayan Singh, known as the Bhumij Rebellion. During the 19th century, large numbers of santals from Manbhum, Hazaribagh, Midnapore were settled by British in Damin-i-koh to cultivate the land and generate revenue.

The Cheros and Kharwars again rebelled against the British in 1882 but the attack was repulsed. Then Birsa Munda revolt, broke out in 1895 and lasted until 1900.

Prominent leaders like Jaipal Singh Munda and Ram Narayan Singh also demanded a separate state. In 1955, the Jharkhand Party, led by Jaipal Singh Munda, submitted a memorandum to the States Reorganization Commission for a separate Jharkhand state comprising the tribal area of South Bihar, but it was rejected because there were many languages, no link language in the region, tribals were in the minority, Hindustani was the majority language, and it risked adverse effect on the economy of Bihar.Later the Sadan people, the native various caste/non-tribal groups, also joined the movement for a separate state. In 1972, Binod Bihari Mahato, Shibu Soren and A. K. Roy founded Jharkhand Mukti Morcha. Nirmal Mahto founded the All Jharkhand Students Union. They led the movement for a separate state of Jharkhand. The Jharkhand coordination committee (JCC), consisting of Ram Dayal Munda, B. P. Keshri, Binod Bihari Mahato, Santosh Rana and Suraj Singh Besra started a new initiative and tried to coordinate between different parties. Keshri sent a memorandum to form Jharkhand state in 1988. The Jharkhand co-ordination committee was then led by Congress General Secretary Ram Ratan Ram, who urged Rajiv Gandhi to pay attention to the issue at hand. \n\nIn July 1988, the Bharatiya Janata party led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Lal Krishna Advani, and Murli Manohar Joshi decided to demand a separate state, Vanachal, comprising the forest region of South Bihar in Jamshedpur. Inder Singh Namdhari, Samresh Singh, and Rudra Pratap Sarangi were the leaders of the Vanachal movement. They organised several rallies to form a separate state.The central government formed a committee on the Jharkhand matter in 1989. It stressed the need for greater allocation of development funds for the area. There was a provision for limited internal autonomy in the hill area of Assam. Other tribal areas were covered by the fifth schedule of the constitution. Chotanagpur and Santal Pargana development boards were constituted under the chairmanship of the then chief minister of Bihar under the provision of the fifth schedule in 1972. This failed to achieve the desired result. Jharkhand Mukti Morcha wanted more representation and the All Jharkhand Students Union was against it. Due to differences these parties broke away from each other. The All Jharkhand Students Union introduced elements of violence in the movement and called for a boycott of election while Jharkhand Mukti Morcha opposed this.

The council has power to recommend legislation to the Assembly through the state government and to frame bylaws and regulations.In 1998, when the separate state movement was falling apart, Justice Lal Pingley Nath Shahdeo was leading the movement. In 1998, the Union government decided to send the bill concerning the formation of the state of Jharkhand to the Bihar Legislative Assembly to which Lalu Prasad Yadav had said that the state would be divided over his dead body. A total of 16 political parties including the Bharatiya Janata Party, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, the All Jharkhand Students Union, and the Congress came in one platform and formed the 'All Party Separate State Formation Committee' to start the movement. Shahdeo was elected as the convener of the committee. Voting on the Jharkhand Act was to be done on 21 September 1998 in Bihar legislation. On that day the committee, under the leadership of Shahdeo called for Jharkhand Bandh and organised a protest march. Thousands of supporters of a separate state took to the streets led by Shahdeo. He was arrested and detained in a police station for hours along with many supporters.In 1999 the Bharatiya Janata party promised to form a separate Vanachal state if they won the state election with a majority of votes. After the last Assembly election in the state resulted in a hung assembly, RJD's dependence on the Congress extended support on the precondition that RJD would not pose a hurdle to the passage of the Bihar reorganisation Bill. Finally, with the support from both RJD and Congress, the ruling coalition at the Centre led by the Bharatiya Janata Party which had made statehood its main poll plank in the region in successive polls earlier, cleared the Bihar reorganisation Bill in the monsoon session of the Parliament on 2 and 11 August in Loksabha and Rajyasabha. This paved the way for the creation of a separate Vanachal state comprising the Chota Nagpur Division and Santhal Pargana Division of South Bihar. NDA formed the government with Babulal Marandi as chief minister. Later the name of the state was changed from Vanachal to Jharkhand. Babulal Marandi took the oath of chief minister on 15 November 2000 on the anniversary of the birth of tribal leader Birsa Munda.\n\n\n=== Jharkhand statehood ===\nThe dynamics of resources and the politics of development still influence the socio-economic structures in Jharkhand, which was carved out of the relatively underdeveloped southern part of Bihar. According to the 1991 census, the state has a population of over 20 million out of which 28% is tribal while 12% of the people belong to scheduled castes. Jharkhand has 24 districts, 260 blocks, and 32,620 villages out of which only 45% have access to electricity while only 8,484 are connected by roads. Jharkhand is the leading producer of mineral wealth in the country after Chhattisgarh state, endowed as it is with a vast variety of minerals like iron ore, coal, copper ore, mica, bauxite, graphite, limestone, and uranium.

Since the uprising of the Naxalites in 1967, 6,000 people have been killed in fighting between the Naxalites and counter-insurgency operations by the police, and its paramilitary groups such as the Salwa Judum.Despite having a presence in almost 7.80% of India's geographical area (home to 5.50% of India's population), the state of Jharkhand is part of the \"Red Corridor\" comprising 92,000 square kilometres, where the highest concentration of the groups estimated 20,000 combatants fight. Part of this is due to the fact that the state harbours an abundance of natural resources, while its people live in abject poverty and destitution. The impoverished state provides ample recruits for communist insurgents, who argue that they are fighting on behalf of the landless poor and tribals that see few benefits from the resource extractions. As the federal government holds a monopoly on sub-surface resources in the state, the tribal population is prevented from staking any claim on the resources extracted from their land. In response, the insurgents have recently begun a campaign of targeting infrastructure related to the extraction of resources vital for Indian energy needs, such as coal.On 5 March 2007, Sunil Mahato, a member of the national parliament, was shot dead by Naxalite rebels near Kishanpur while watching a football match on the Hindu festival of Holi.

As far back as 1918, facilities were set up for treatment of mentally challenged.European Mental Hospital was established along with Indian Mental Hospital. Today they are called Central Institute of Psychiatry and Ranchi Institute of Neuro-psychiatry and Allied Sciences respectively.\nIn certain areas of Jharkhand, poverty and consequent malnutrition have given rise to diseases like tuberculosis (TB). In fact, TB has assumed epidemic proportions in certain areas of the state. For management and treatment of such TB, Itki TB Sanatorium, Ranchi, established in 1928 has been doing work as a premier institute for clinical and programmatic management of TB. The Itki TB Sanatorium is well equipped and accredited by the Indian government for quality assurance and Culture and Drug Sensitivity Testing for M.TB. It provides free of cost treatment for TB as well as drug-resistant TB. Likewise, in the field of treatment of cancer, Tata Main Hospital, Jamshedpur, is rendering pioneering work. In the same way, Bokaro General Hospital equipped with modern facilities for the treatment of cancer and heart-related problems with the capacity of 1100 beds one of the largest in eastern India.\nAlthough several public and private health facilities are available in the state, overall infrastructure for dispensing health related services require improvements. An exception is the Tata Motors Hospital which is an example of an ISO 14001 and 18001 certified hospital with DNB teaching facilities.Ranchi, the capital, has witnessed a sharp growth in the number of hospitals.\nFluoride in groundwater presents a public health problem in Jharkhand. A recent survey led by the Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi in collaboration with UNICEF in the northwest districts of Palamau and Garhwa found fluoride levels above the drinking WHO drinking water guidelines. Excessive amounts of fluoride in drinking water can lead to dental fluorosis, prevalent bone fractures, and skeletal fluorosis, an irreversible disabling condition. Some work has focused on combating fluorosis through increased calcium intake by consuming local plants. Researchers at Princeton University and the Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi are currently investigating defluoridation options, while performing an epidemiological survey to assess the extent of fluoride linked health problems and the impact of future interventions.Almost 80% of Jharkhand's people are farmers, although it contains 40% of India's mineral reserves it has some of India's poorest people, in Summer 2009 the state was threatened by drought, with people criticising the government for not providing food aid or assistance.", "start_char_idx": 37352, "end_char_idx": 40216, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "388f906a-b6f0-40ad-a54f-9c45a3c8449f": {"__data__": {"id_": "388f906a-b6f0-40ad-a54f-9c45a3c8449f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Jharkhand.txt", "file_name": "Jharkhand.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 44025, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "595bdffe-5d86-45fc-ac1a-fdd2ec7d1f0d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Jharkhand.txt", "file_name": "Jharkhand.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 44025, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "91522f4e65ae81e9fff46b312455c2f782b42d76605ce8db44648263cdddfd3f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c8899158-1d5a-44e2-87ba-3f6364f7d4ba", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Jharkhand.txt", "file_name": "Jharkhand.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 44025, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "00096d355af4873f9037b2d10814481e77a6e299ac546240e68cba97417d894a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "daa25241-2d4b-4fab-b03d-69d0a39be0ec", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8710c0359464f9e021544b98421d54ccac9e7980c15da9707efc08c07876193e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Sports ==\nJRD TATA Sports Complex, Jamshedpur hosts football matches of Indian Super League and is the home of ISL based football club Jamshedpur FC.\nCricket, hockey, and football are common games in Jharkhand.

It was formed as Mysore State on 1 November 1956, with the passage of the States Reorganisation Act, and renamed Karnataka in 1973. The state was part of the Carnatic region in British terminology. Its capital and largest city is Bengaluru (Bangalore).\nKarnataka is bordered by the Lakshadweep Sea to the west, Goa to the northwest, Maharashtra to the north, Telangana to the northeast, Andhra Pradesh to the east, Tamil Nadu to the southeast, and Kerala to the southwest. It is the only southern state to have land borders with all of the other four southern Indian sister states. The state covers an area of 191,791 km2 (74,051 sq mi), or 5.83 per cent of the total geographical area of India. It is the sixth-largest Indian state by area. With 61,130,704 inhabitants at the 2011 census, Karnataka is the eighth-largest state by population, comprising 31 districts. Kannada, one of the classical languages of India, is the most widely spoken and official language of the state. Other minority languages spoken include Urdu, Konkani, Marathi, Tulu, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kodava and Beary. Karnataka also contains some of the only villages in India where Sanskrit is primarily spoken.Though several etymologies have been suggested for the name Karnataka, the generally accepted one is that Karnataka is derived from the Kannada words karu and n\u0101du, meaning \"elevated land\". Karu Nadu may also be read as karu, meaning \"black\" and nadu, meaning \"region\", as a reference to the black cotton soil found in the Bayalu Seeme region of the state. The British used the word Carnatic, sometimes Karnatak, to describe both sides of peninsular India, south of the Krishna.With an antiquity that dates to the paleolithic, Karnataka has been home to some of the most powerful empires of ancient and medieval India. The philosophers and musical bards patronised by these empires launched socio-religious and literary movements which have endured to the present day. Karnataka has contributed significantly to both forms of Indian classical music, the Carnatic and Hindustani traditions.\nThe economy of Karnataka is the fifth-largest of any Indian state with \u20b920.5 trillion (US$260 billion) in gross domestic product and a per capita GDP of \u20b9305,000 (US$3,800). Karnataka has the fifteenth-highest ranking among Indian states in Human Development Index.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n\n== History ==\n\nKarnataka's pre-history goes back to a paleolithic hand-axe culture evidenced by discoveries of, among other things, hand axes and cleavers in the region. Evidence of neolithic and megalithic cultures have also been found in the state. Gold discovered in Harappa was found to be imported from mines in Karnataka, prompting scholars to hypothesise about contacts between ancient Karnataka and the Indus Valley civilisation c.\u20093300 BCE.Prior to the third century BCE, most of Karnataka formed part of the Nanda Empire before coming under the Mauryan empire of Emperor Ashoka.

The decline of Satavahana power led to the rise of the earliest native kingdoms, the Kadambas and the Western Gangas, marking the region's emergence as an independent political entity. The Kadamba Dynasty, founded by Mayurasharma, had its capital at Banavasi; the Western Ganga Dynasty was formed with Talakad as its capital.These were also the first kingdoms to use Kannada in administration, as evidenced by the Halmidi inscription and a fifth-century copper coin discovered at Banavasi. These dynasties were followed by imperial Kannada empires such as the Badami Chalukyas, the Rashtrakuta Empire of Manyakheta and the Western Chalukya Empire, which ruled over large parts of the Deccan and had their capitals in what is now Karnataka. The Western Chalukyas patronised a unique style of architecture and Kannada literature which became a precursor to the Hoysala art of the 12th century. Parts of modern-day Southern Karnataka (Gangavadi) were occupied by the Chola Empire at the turn of the 11th century. The Cholas and the Hoysalas fought over the region in the early 12th century before it eventually came under Hoysala rule.At the turn of the first millennium, the Hoysalas gained power in the region. Literature flourished during this time, which led to the emergence of distinctive Kannada literary metres, and the construction of temples and sculptures adhering to the Vesara style of architecture. The expansion of the Hoysala Empire brought minor parts of modern Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu under its rule. In the early 14th century, Harihara and Bukka Raya established the Vijayanagara empire with its capital, Hosapattana (later named Vijayanagara), on the banks of the Tungabhadra River in the modern Bellary district. Under the rule of Krishnadevaraya, a distinct form of literature and architecture evolved. The empire rose as a bulwark against Muslim advances into South India, which it completely controlled for over two centuries. In 1537,  Kempe Gowda I, a chieftain of the Vijayanagara Empire, widely held as the founder of modern Bangalore, built a fort and established the area around it as Bengaluru Pete.In 1565, Karnataka and the rest of South India experienced a major geopolitical shift when the Vijayanagara empire fell to a confederation of Islamic sultanates in the Battle of Talikota. The Bijapur Sultanate, which had risen after the demise of the Bahmani Sultanate of Bidar, soon took control of the Deccan; it was defeated by the Moghuls in the late 17th century. The Bahmani and Bijapur rulers encouraged Urdu and Persian literature and Indo-Saracenic architecture, the Gol Gumbaz being one of the high points of this style. During the sixteenth century, Konkani Hindus migrated to Karnataka, mostly from Salcette, Goa, while during the seventeenth and eighteenth century, Goan Catholics migrated to North Canara and South Canara, especially from Bardes, Goa, as a result of food shortages, epidemics and heavy taxation imposed by the Portuguese.In the period that followed, parts of northern Karnataka were ruled by the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Maratha Empire, the British, and other powers.

With the death of Krishnaraja Wodeyar II, Haidar Ali, the commander-in-chief of the Mysore army, gained control of the region. After his death, the kingdom was inherited by his son Tipu Sultan. To contain European expansion in South India, Haidar Ali and later Tipu Sultan fought four significant Anglo-Mysore Wars, the last of which resulted in Tippu Sultan's death and the incorporation of Mysore into British India in 1799. Mysore was restored to the Wodeyars, and the Kingdom of Mysore became a princely state outside but in a subsidiary alliance with British India.\nAs the \"doctrine of lapse\" gave way to dissent and resistance from princely states across the country, Kittur Chennamma, Queen of Kittur, her military leader Sangolli Rayanna, and others, spearheaded rebellions in part of what is now Karnataka in 1830, nearly three decades before the Indian Rebellion of 1857. However, Kitturu was taken over by the British East India Company even before the doctrine was officially articulated by Lord Dalhousie in 1848. Other uprisings followed, such as the ones at Supa, Bagalkot, Shorapur, Nargund and Dandeli. These rebellions\u2014which coincided with the Indian Rebellion of 1857\u2014were led by Mundargi Bhimarao, Bhaskar Rao Bhave, the Halagali Bedas, Raja Venkatappa Nayaka and others.

Nijalingappa, Kengal Hanumanthaiah, Nittoor Srinivasa Rau and others carried on the struggle into the early 20th century.After the independence of British India, the Maharaja, Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar, signed an instrument of accession to accede his state to the new India. In 1950, Mysore became an Indian state of the same name; the former Maharaja served as its Rajpramukh (head of state) until 1975. Following the long-standing demand of the Ekikarana Movement, Kodagu- and Kannada-speaking regions from the adjoining states of Madras, Hyderabad and Bombay were incorporated into the Mysore state, under the States Reorganisation Act of 1956.

The highest point in Karnataka is the Mullayanagiri hills in Chikmagalur district which has an altitude of 1,925 m (6,316 ft). The two main river systems of the state are the Krishna and its tributaries, the Bhima, Ghataprabha, Vedavathi, Malaprabha and Tungabhadra in North Karnataka, and the Kaveri and its tributaries, the Hemavati, Shimsha, Arkavati, Lakshmana Thirtha and Kabini, in South Karnataka. Most of these rivers flow out of Karnataka eastward, reaching the sea at the Bay of Bengal. Other prominent rivers such as the Sharavati in Shimoga and Netravati in Dakshina Kannada flow westward to the Lakshadweep Sea. A large number of dams and reservoirs are constructed across these rivers which richly add to the irrigation and hydroelectricity power generation capacities of the state.Karnataka consists of four main types of geological formations \u2013 the Archean complex made up of Dharwad schists and granitic gneisses, the Proterozoic non-fossiliferous sedimentary formations of the Kaladgi and Bhima series, the Deccan trappean and intertrappean deposits and the tertiary and recent laterites and alluvial deposits. Laterite cappings that are found in many districts over the Deccan Traps were formed after the cessation of volcanic activity in the early tertiary period. Eleven groups of soil orders are found in Karnataka, viz. Entisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Spodosols, Alfisols, Ultisols, Oxisols, Aridisols, Vertisols, Andisols and Histosols. Depending on the agricultural capability of the soil, the soil types are divided into six types, viz. red, lateritic, black, alluvio-colluvial, forest and coastal soils.About 38,284 km2 (14,782 sq mi) of Karnataka (i.e. 16% of the state's geographic area) is covered by forests. The forests are classified as reserved, protected, unclosed, village and private forests.

These forests support 25% of the elephant and 10% of the tiger population of India. Many regions of Karnataka are as yet unexplored, so new species of flora and fauna are found periodically. The Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot, includes the western region of Karnataka. The Bandipur and Nagarahole National Parks were included in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve in 1986, a UNESCO designation. The Indian roller and the Indian elephant are recognised as the state bird and animal while sandalwood and the lotus are recognised as the state tree and flower respectively.

The districts are further divided into sub-districts (talukas), which are governed by sub-commissioners (talukdars); sub-divisions comprise blocks (tehsils/hobli), which are governed by block development officers (tehsildars), which contain village councils (panchayats), town municipal councils (purasabhe), city municipal councils (nagarasabhe), and city municipal corporations (mahanagara palike).", "start_char_idx": 12416, "end_char_idx": 14938, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9cfa24f0-764a-4fa5-93ac-cfe150005317": {"__data__": {"id_": "9cfa24f0-764a-4fa5-93ac-cfe150005317", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Karnataka.txt", "file_name": "Karnataka.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49606, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5b96805f-b0d4-45d1-91e4-9954d951ca5b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Karnataka.txt", "file_name": "Karnataka.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49606, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "fde4755843f87af7a8d219b58c3cd82558d869b82b0af0ab56138747dd173b64", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "87507a7d-8dcc-4156-a449-d089ea1bac41", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Karnataka.txt", "file_name": "Karnataka.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49606, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "fd8c350d71057833b989209a296a9a9f477b6c9c9ec1169b9eb293d1fc890a1a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "964549dc-3e07-457a-ad74-47f171b866ca", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "653c28afa06ee153802b4c7208a24e2777459123562e9f640ca103b829ab1d8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to the 2011 census of India, the total population of Karnataka was 61,095,297 of which 30,966,657 (50.7%) were male and 30,128,640 (49.3%) were female, or 1000 males for every 973 females. This represents a 15.60% increase over the population in 2001. The population density was 319 per km2 and 38.67% of the people lived in urban areas. The literacy rate was 75.36% with 82.47% of males and 68.08% of females being literate.In 2007 the state had a birth rate of 2.2%, a death rate of 0.7%, an infant mortality rate of 5.5% and a maternal mortality rate of 0.2%. The total fertility rate was 2.2.Karnataka's private sector speciality health care competes with the best in the world. Karnataka has also established a modicum of public health services having a better record of health care and child care than most other states of India. In spite of these advances, some parts of the state still suffer from the lack of primary health care.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nAdi Shankara (788\u2013820 CE) chose Sringeri in Karnataka to establish the first of his four mathas (monastery). Madhvacharya (1238\u20131317) was the chief proponent of Tattvavada (philosophy of reality), popularly known as Dvaita or Dualistic school of Hindu philosophy \u2013 one of the three most influential Vedanta philosophies. Madhvacharya was one of the important philosophers during the Bhakti movement. He was a pioneer in many ways, going against standard conventions and norms. According to tradition, Madhvacharya is believed to be the third incarnation of Vayu (Mukhyaprana), after Hanuman and Bhima. The Haridasa devotional movement is considered one of the turning points in the cultural history of India. Over a span of nearly six centuries, several saints and mystics helped shape the culture, philosophy, and art of South India and Karnataka in particular by exerting considerable spiritual influence over the masses and kingdoms that ruled South India.This movement was ushered in by the Haridasas (literally \"servants of Hari\") and took shape in the 13th century \u2013 14th century CE, period, prior to and during the early rule of the Vijayanagara empire. The main objective of this movement was to propagate the Dvaita philosophy of Madhvacharya (Madhva Siddhanta) to the masses through a literary medium known as Dasa Sahitya. Purandara dasa is widely recognised as the \"Pithamaha\" of Carnatic Music for his immense contribution. Ramanuja, the leading expounder of Vishishtadvaita, spent many years in Melkote. He came to Karnataka in 1098 CE and lived here until 1122 CE. He first lived in Tondanur and then moved to Melkote where the Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple and a well-organised matha were built. He was patronised by the Hoysala king, Vishnuvardhana.In the twelfth century, Lingayatism emerged in northern Karnataka as a protest against the rigidity of the prevailing social and caste system. Leading figures of this movement were Basava, Akka Mahadevi and Allama Prabhu, who established the Anubhava Mantapa which was the centre of all religious and philosophical thoughts and discussions pertaining to Lingayats.", "start_char_idx": 14941, "end_char_idx": 18059, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "964549dc-3e07-457a-ad74-47f171b866ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "964549dc-3e07-457a-ad74-47f171b866ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Karnataka.txt", "file_name": "Karnataka.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49606, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5b96805f-b0d4-45d1-91e4-9954d951ca5b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Karnataka.txt", "file_name": "Karnataka.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49606, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "fde4755843f87af7a8d219b58c3cd82558d869b82b0af0ab56138747dd173b64", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9cfa24f0-764a-4fa5-93ac-cfe150005317", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Karnataka.txt", "file_name": "Karnataka.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49606, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "4bfcb8b0468e877fab9b57a231cc8705fa6a22a4a2d96dcbdd51b76b73c282ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "89fae948-ab52-4c7d-9553-804794093d41", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "88ad4f1bddb0b3401c7408dbce7e8712b2165d24e721a0353d6aac814f05dd70", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Leading figures of this movement were Basava, Akka Mahadevi and Allama Prabhu, who established the Anubhava Mantapa which was the centre of all religious and philosophical thoughts and discussions pertaining to Lingayats. These three social reformers did so by the literary means of \"Vachana Sahitya\" which is very famous for its simple, straight forward and easily understandable Kannada language. Lingayatism preached women equality by letting women wear Ishtalinga i.e. Symbol of god around their neck. Basava shunned the sharp hierarchical divisions that existed and sought to remove all distinctions between the hierarchically superior master class and the subordinate, servile class. He also supported inter-caste marriages and Kaay Ta tTatva of Basavanna. This was the basis of the Lingayat faith which today counts millions among its followers.The Jain philosophy and literature have contributed immensely to the religious and cultural landscape of Karnataka.Islam, which had an early presence on the west coast of India as early as the tenth century, gained a foothold in Karnataka with the rise of the Bahamani and Bijapur sultanates that ruled parts of Karnataka. Christianity reached Karnataka in the sixteenth century with the arrival of the Portuguese and St. Francis Xavier in 1545.Buddhism was popular in Karnataka during the first millennium in places such as Gulbarga and Banavasi. A chance discovery of edicts and several Mauryan relics at Sannati in Kalaburagi district in 1986 has proven that the Krishna River basin was once home to both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhism. There are Tibetan refugee camps in Karnataka.\n\n\n==== Festivals ====\nMysore Dasara is celebrated as the Nada habba (state festival) and this is marked by major festivities at Mysore. Bangalore Karaga, celebrated in the heart of Bangalore, is the second most important festival celebrated in Karnataka.

Telugu (5.84%) is a major language in areas bordering Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka as well as Bangalore, while Tamil (3.45%) is a major language of Bangalore and in the Kolar district. Marathi (3.29%) is concentrated in areas of Uttara Kannada, Belgaum and Bidar districts bordering Maharashtra. Lambadi is spoken by the Lambadis scattered throughout North Karnataka, while Hindi is spoken in Bangalore. Tulu (2.61%), Konkani (1.29%), and Malayalam (1.27%) are all found in linguistically diverse Coastal Karnataka, where a number of mixed and distinct dialects such as Are Bhashe, Beary Bhashe, and Nawayathi are found.

Tulu, Konkani and Kodava are other minor native languages that share a long history in the state. Urdu is spoken widely by the Muslim population. Less widely spoken languages include Beary bashe and certain languages such as Sankethi. Some of the regional languages in Karnataka are Tulu, Kodava, Konkani and Beary.Kannada features a rich and ancient body of literature including religious and secular genre, covering topics as diverse as Jainism (such as Puranas), Lingayatism (such as Vachanas), Vaishnavism (such as Haridasa Sahitya) and modern literature. Evidence from edicts during the time of Ashoka (reigned 274\u2013232 BCE) suggest that Buddhist literature influenced the Kannada script and its literature. The Halmidi inscription, the earliest attested full-length inscription in the Kannada language and script, dates from 450 CE, while the earliest available literary work, the Kavirajamarga, has been dated to 850 CE. References made in the Kavirajamarga, however, prove that Kannada literature flourished in the native composition metres such as Chattana, Beddande and Melvadu during earlier centuries. The classic refers to several earlier greats (purvacharyar) of Kannada poetry and prose.Kuvempu, the renowned Kannada poet and writer who wrote Jaya Bharata Jananiya Tanujate, the state anthem of Karnataka\nwas the first recipient of the Karnataka Ratna, the highest civilian award bestowed by the Government of Karnataka. Contemporary Kannada literature has received considerable acknowledgement in the arena of Indian literature, with eight Kannada writers winning India's highest literary honour, the Jnanpith award.Tulu is the majority language in the coastal district of Dakshina Kannada and is the second most spoken in the Udupi district. This region is also known as Tulu Nadu. Tulu Mahabharato, written by Arunabja in the Tigalari script, is the oldest surviving Tulu text. Tigalari script was used by Brahmins to write Sanskrit language. The use of the Kannada script for writing Tulu and non-availability of print in Tigalari script contributed to the marginalisation of Tigalari script.\nIn Karnataka Konkani is mostly spoken in the Uttara Kannada and Dakshina Kannada districts and in parts of Udupi, Konkani use the Devanagari Script (which is official)/Kannada script( Optional ) for writing as identified by government of Karnataka.The Kodavas who mainly reside in the Kodagu district, speak Kodava Takk. Kodagu was a separate State with its own Chief Minister and Council of Ministers till 1956.  Two regional variations of the language exist, the northern Mendale Takka and the southern Kiggaati Takka. Kodava Takk has its own script, Karnataka Kodava Sahitya Academy has accepted I. M. Muthanna's script which was developed in 1970 as the official script of Kodava Thakk.

(English:  KERR-\u0259-l\u0259), called Keralam in Malayalam (Malayalam: [ke:\u027e\u0250\u026d\u0250m] ), is a state on the Malabar Coast of India. It was formed on 1 November 1956, following the passage of the States Reorganisation Act, by combining Malayalam-speaking regions of the erstwhile regions of Cochin, Malabar, South Canara, and Travancore. Spread over 38,863 km2 (15,005 sq mi), Kerala is the 21st largest Indian state by area. It is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Sea to the west. With 33 million inhabitants as per the 2011 census, Kerala is the 13th-largest Indian state by population. It is divided into 14 districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram. Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state.The Chera dynasty was the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala. The Ay kingdom in the deep south and the Ezhimala kingdom in the north formed the other kingdoms in the early years of the Common Era (CE). The region had been a prominent spice exporter since 3000 BCE. The region's prominence in trade was noted in the works of Pliny as well as the Periplus around 100 CE. In the 15th century, the spice trade attracted Portuguese traders to Kerala, and paved the way for European colonisation of India. At the time of Indian independence movement in the early 20th century, there were two major princely states in Kerala: Travancore and Cochin. They united to form the state of Thiru-Kochi in 1949. The Malabar region, in the northern part of Kerala, had been a part of the Madras province of British India, which later became a part of the Madras State post-independence. After the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, the modern-day state of Kerala was formed by merging the Malabar district of Madras State (excluding Gudalur taluk of Nilgiris district, Lakshadweep Islands, Topslip, the Attappadi Forest east of Anakatti), the taluk of Kasaragod (now Kasaragod District) in South Canara, and the erstwhile state of Thiru-Kochi (excluding four southern taluks of Kanyakumari district, and Shenkottai taluks).Kerala has the lowest positive population growth rate in India, 3.44%; the highest Human Development Index (HDI), 0.784 in 2018 (0.712 in 2015); the highest literacy rate, 96.2% in the 2018 literacy survey conducted by the National Statistical Office, India; the highest life expectancy, 77.3 years; and the highest sex ratio, 1,084 women per 1,000 men. Kerala is the least impoverished state in India according to NITI Aayog's Sustainable Development Goals dashboard and Reserve Bank of India's 'Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy'. Kerala is the second-most urbanised major state in the country with 47.7% urban population according to the 2011 Census of India. The state topped in the country to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals according to the annual report of NITI Aayog published in 2019.

The tertiary sector contributes around 65% to state's GSVA, while the primary sector contributes only 8%. The state has witnessed significant emigration, especially to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf during the Gulf Boom of the 1970s and early 1980s, and its economy depends significantly on remittances from a large Malayali expatriate community. The production of pepper and natural rubber contributes significantly to the total national output. In the agricultural sector, coconut, tea, coffee, cashew and spices are important. The state is situated between Arabian Sea to the west and Western Ghats mountain ranges to the east. The state's coastline extends for 595 kilometres (370 mi), and around 1.1 million people in the state are dependent on the fishery industry, which contributes 3% to the state's income.

At that time, one of three states in the region was called Cheralam in Classical Tamil: Chera and Kera are variants of the same word. The word Cheral refers to the oldest known dynasty of Kerala kings and is derived from the Proto-Tamil-Malayalam word for 'lake'. Keralam may stem from the Classical Tamil cherive-alam 'declivity of a hill or a mountain slope' or chera alam 'land of the Cheras'.\nOne folk etymology derives Kerala from the Malayalam word kera 'coconut tree' and alam 'land'; thus, 'land of coconuts', which is a nickname for the state used by locals due to the abundance of coconut trees.The earliest Sanskrit text to mention Kerala as Cherapadha is the late Vedic text Aitareya Aranyaka. Kerala is also mentioned in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the two Hindu epics. The Skanda Purana mentions the ecclesiastical office of the Thachudaya Kaimal who is referred to as Manikkam Keralar, synonymous with the deity of the Koodalmanikyam temple.

Earlier, the term Malabar had also been used to denote Tulu Nadu and Kanyakumari which lie contiguous to Kerala on the southwestern coast of India, in addition to the modern state of Kerala. The people of Malabar were known as Malabars. Until the arrival of the East India Company, the term Malabar was used as a general name for Kerala, along with the term Kerala. From the time of Cosmas Indicopleustes (6th century CE) itself, the Arab sailors used to call Kerala as Male. The first element of the name, however, is attested already in the Topography written by Cosmas Indicopleustes. This mentions a pepper emporium called Male, which clearly gave its name to Malabar ('the country of Male'). The name Male is thought to come from the Malayalam word Mala ('hill'). Al-Biruni (973\u20131048 CE) is the first known writer to call this country Malabar. Authors such as Ibn Khordadbeh and Al-Baladhuri mention Malabar ports in their works. The Arab writers had called this place Malibar, Manibar, Mulibar, and Munibar. Malabar is reminiscent of the word Malanad which means the land of hills. According to William Logan, the word Malabar comes from a combination of the Malayalam word Mala (hill) and the Persian/Arabic word Barr (country/continent).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Traditional sources ===\nAccording to the Sangam classic Purananuru, the Chera king Senkuttuvan conquered the lands between Kanyakumari and the Himalayas. Lacking worthy enemies, he besieged the sea by throwing his spear into it. According to the 17th-century Hindu mythology work Keralolpathi, the lands of Kerala were recovered from the sea by the axe-wielding warrior sage Parasurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu (hence, Kerala is also called Parasurama Kshetram 'The Land of Parasurama' in Hindu mythology). Parasurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded as far as it reached. According to the legendary account, this new area of land extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari. The land which rose from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation; so Parasurama invoked the Snake King Vasuki, who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land. P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar theorised, that Senguttuvan may have been inspired by the Parasurama legendary account, which was brought by early Aryan settlers.Another much earlier Puranic character associated with Kerala is Mahabali, an Asura and a prototypical just king, who ruled the earth from Kerala. He won the war against the Devas, driving them into exile. The Devas pleaded before Lord Vishnu, who took his fifth incarnation as Vamana and pushed Mahabali down to netherworld to placate the Devas. There is a belief that, once a year during the Onam festival, Mahabali returns to Kerala. The Matsya Purana, among the oldest of the 18 Puranas, uses the Malaya Mountains of Kerala (and Tamil Nadu) as the setting for the story of Matsya, the first incarnation of Vishnu, and Manu, the first man and the king of the region.", "start_char_idx": 5717, "end_char_idx": 8879, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f844075a-ded1-48b9-8d26-22ef10de78c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "f844075a-ded1-48b9-8d26-22ef10de78c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Kerala.txt", "file_name": "Kerala.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 121009, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8305a4d4-9fba-4cf0-9d26-dc88545eccc1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Kerala.txt", "file_name": "Kerala.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 121009, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "b9c4f19f66c535c0cd324e82e05ffd64abf79b7d11b11ded8024fb6a0e60c2cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3074b9c3-4cd1-473d-98c5-514cefcb22a9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Kerala.txt", "file_name": "Kerala.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 121009, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "7a018287cc51023e60b2db9a7ac4006ce83872c646b38cfa545caa6b73cda695", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8d13b6cb-f38d-41b7-8f65-1de3cf522cb9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fdf3cd90103fd5457ae1ba8c8115db2e73930395d09f455bff473ff7500d1bcb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "==== Ophir ====\nOphir, a port or region mentioned in the Bible, famous for its wealth, is often identified with some coastal areas of Kerala.

A Dictionary of the Bible by Sir William Smith, published in 1863, notes the Hebrew word for parrot Thukki, derived from the Classical Tamil for peacock Thogkai and Cingalese Tokei, joins other Classical Tamil words for ivory, cotton-cloth and apes preserved in the Hebrew Bible. This theory of Ophir's location in Tamilakam is further supported by other historians. The most likely location on the coast of Kerala conjectured to be Ophir is Poovar in Thiruvananthapuram District (though some Indian scholars also suggest Beypore as possible location). The Books of Kings and Chronicles tell of a joint expedition to Ophir by King Solomon and the Tyrian king Hiram I from Ezion-Geber, a port on the Red Sea, that brought back large amounts of gold, precious stones and 'algum wood' and of a later failed expedition by king Jehoshaphat of Judah.

The validity of the legend as a source of history once generated much debate among South Indian historians. The legend was used by Kerala chiefdoms for the legitimation of their rule (most of the major chiefly houses in medieval Kerala traced its origin back to the legendary allocation by the Perumal). According to the legend, Rayar, the overlord of the Cheraman Perumal in a country east of the Ghats, invaded Kerala during the rule of the last Perumal. To drive back the invading forces the Perumal summoned the militia of his chieftains (like Udaya Varman Kolathiri, Manichchan, and Vikkiran of Eranad). The Cheraman Perumal was assured by the Eradis (chief of Eranad) that they would take a fort established by the Rayar. The battle lasted for three days and the Rayar eventually evacuated his fort (and it was seized by the Perumal's troops). Then the last Cheraman Perumal divided Kerala or Chera kingdom among his chieftains and disappeared mysteriously. The Kerala people never more heard any tidings of him. The Eradis of Nediyiruppu, who later came to be known as the Zamorins of Kozhikode, who were left out in cold during allocation of the land, was granted the Cheraman Perumal's sword (with the permission to \"die, and kill, and seize\").According to the Cheraman Juma Mosque and some other narratives, \"Once a Cheraman Perumal probably named Ravi Varma was walking with his queen in the palace, when he witnessed the splitting of the moon. Shocked by this, he asked his astronomers to note down the exact time of the splitting. Then, when some Arab merchants visited his palace, he asked them about this incident. Their answers led the King to Mecca, where he met Islamic prophet Muhammad and converted to Islam. It is assumed that the first recorded version of this legend is an Arabic manuscript of anonymous authorship known as Qissat Shakarwati Farmad. The 16th century Arabic work Tuhfat Ul Mujahideen authored by Zainuddin Makhdoom II of Ponnani, as well as the medieval Malayalam work Keralolpathi, also mention about the departure of last Cheraman Perumal of Kerala into Mecca.However, S.

Marine fossils have been found in an area near Changanassery, thus supporting the hypothesis. Pre-historical archaeological findings include dolmens of the Neolithic era in the Marayur area of the Idukki district, which lie on the eastern highland made by Western Ghats. They are locally known as \"muniyara\", derived from muni (hermit or sage) and ara (dolmen). Rock engravings in the Edakkal Caves, in Wayanad date back to the Neolithic era around 6000 BCE. Archaeological studies have identified Mesolithic, Neolithic and Megalithic sites in Kerala. The studies point to the development of ancient Kerala society and its culture beginning from the Paleolithic Age, through the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Megalithic Ages. Foreign cultural contacts have assisted this cultural formation; historians suggest a possible relationship with Indus Valley civilisation during the late Bronze Age and early Iron Age.\n\n\n=== Ancient period ===\nKerala has been a major spice exporter since 3000 BCE, according to Sumerian records and it is still referred to as the \"Garden of Spices\" or as the \"Spice Garden of India\".:\u200a79\u200a Kerala's spices attracted ancient Arabs, Babylonians, Assyrians and Egyptians to the Malabar Coast in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE. Phoenicians established trade with Kerala during this period. Arabs and Phoenicians were the first to enter Malabar Coast to trade Spices. The Arabs on the coasts of Yemen, Oman, and the Persian Gulf, must have made the first long voyage to Kerala and other eastern countries. They must have brought the Cinnamon of Kerala to the Middle East. The Greek historian Herodotus (5th century BCE) records that in his time the cinnamon spice industry was monopolised by the Egyptians and the Phoenicians.The Land of Keralaputra was one of the four independent kingdoms in southern India during Ashoka's time, the others being Chola, Pandya, and Satiyaputra. Scholars hold that Keralaputra is an alternate name of the Cheras, the first dominant dynasty who ruled Kerala, and had its capital at Karur. These territories once shared a common language and culture, within an area known as Tamilakam. The region around Coimbatore was ruled by the Cheras during Sangam period between 1st and the 4th centuries CE and it served as the eastern entrance to the Palakkad Gap, the principal trade route between the Malabar Coast and Tamil Nadu. Along with the Ay kingdom in the south and the Ezhimala kingdom in the north, the Cheras formed the ruling kingdoms of Kerala in the early years of the Common Era (CE). It is noted in Sangam literature that the Chera king Uthiyan Cheralathan ruled most of modern Kerala from his capital in Kuttanad, and controlled the port of Muziris, but its southern tip was in the kingdom of Pandyas, which had a trading port sometimes identified in ancient Western sources as Nelcynda (or Neacyndi) in Quilon.

The lesser known Ays and Mushikas kingdoms lay to the south and north of the Chera regions, respectively. Pliny the Elder (1st century CE) states that the port of Tyndis was located at the northwestern border of Keprobotos (Chera dynasty). The North Malabar region, which lies north of the port at Tyndis, was ruled by the kingdom of Ezhimala during Sangam period. The port at Tyndis which was on the northern side of Muziris, as mentioned in Greco-Roman writings, was somewhere around Kozhikode. Its exact location is a matter of dispute. The suggested locations are Ponnani, Tanur, Beypore-Chaliyam-Kadalundi-Vallikkunnu, and Koyilandy.According to the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a region known as Limyrike began at Naura and Tyndis. However the Ptolemy mentions only Tyndis as the Limyrike's starting point. The region probably ended at Kanyakumari; it thus roughly corresponds to the present-day Malabar Coast. The value of Rome's annual trade with the region was estimated at 50,000,000 sesterces. According to Pliny the Elder, goods from India were sold in the Empire at 100 times their original purchase price. Pliny the Elder mentioned that Limyrike was prone to raids by pirates. The Cosmas Indicopleustes mentioned that the Limyrike was a source of Malabar peppers. In the last centuries BCE the coast became important to the Greeks and Romans for its spices, especially Malabar pepper. The Cheras had trading links with China, West Asia, Egypt, Greece, and the Roman Empire. In foreign-trade circles the region was known as Male or Malabar. Muziris, Tyndis, Naura, Nelcynda, and Barace, were among the principal ports at that time. Contemporary Sangam literature describes Roman ships coming to Muziris in Kerala, laden with gold to exchange for Malabar pepper. One of the earliest western traders to use the monsoon winds to reach Kerala was Eudoxus of Cyzicus, around 118 or 166 BCE, under the patronage of Ptolemy VIII, king of the Hellenistic Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt. Roman establishments in the port cities of the region, such as a temple of Augustus and barracks for garrisoned Roman soldiers, are marked in the Tabula Peutingeriana, the only surviving map of the Roman cursus publicus.Merchants from West Asia and Southern Europe established coastal posts and settlements in Kerala. The Israeli (Jewish) connection with Kerala started in 573 BCE. Arabs also had trade links with Kerala, starting before the 4th century BCE, as Herodotus (484\u2013413 BCE) noted that goods brought by Arabs from Kerala were sold to the Israelis [Hebrew Jews] at Eden.

During the early part of the Kulasekara period, the southern region from Nagercoil to Thiruvalla was ruled by Ay kings, who lost their power in the 10th century, making the region a part of the Kulasekara empire. Under Kulasekhara rule, Kerala witnessed a developing period of art, literature, trade and the Bhakti movement of Hinduism. A Keralite identity, distinct from the Tamils, became linguistically separate during this period around the seventh century. The origin of Malayalam calendar dates back to year 825 CE. For local administration, the empire was divided into provinces under the rule of Naduvazhis, with each province comprising a number of Desams under the control of chieftains, called as Desavazhis. Mamankam festival, which was the largest native festival, was held at Tirunavaya near Kuttippuram, on the bank of river Bharathappuzha. Athavanad, the headquarters of Azhvanchery Thamprakkal, who were also considered as the supreme religious chief of the Nambudiri Brahmins of Kerala, is also located near Tirunavaya.Sulaiman al-Tajir, a Persian merchant who visited Kerala during the reign of Sthanu Ravi Varma (9th century CE), records that there was extensive trade between Kerala and China at that time, based at the port of Kollam. A number of foreign accounts have mentioned about the presence of considerable Muslim population in the coastal towns. Arab writers such as Al-Masudi of Baghdad (896\u2013956 CE), Muhammad al-Idrisi (1100\u20131165 CE), Abulfeda (1273\u20131331 CE), and Al-Dimashqi (1256\u20131327 CE) mention the Muslim communities in Kerala. Some historians assume that the Mappilas can be considered as the first native, settled Muslim community in South Asia. The known earliest mention about Muslims of Kerala is in the Quilon Syrian copper plates.\nThe inhibitions, caused by a series of Chera-Chola wars in the 11th century, resulted in the decline of foreign trade in Kerala ports. In addition, Portuguese invasions in the 15th century caused two major religions, Buddhism and Jainism, to disappear from the land. It is known that the Menons in the Malabar region of Kerala were originally strong believers of Jainism. The social system became fractured with divisions on caste lines. Finally, the Kulasekhara dynasty was subjugated in 1102 by the combined attack of Later Pandyas and Later Cholas.

The port at Kozhikode held the superior economic and political position in Kerala, while Kollam (Quilon), Kochi, and Kannur (Cannanore) were commercially confined to secondary roles. The Zamorin of Calicut was originally the ruler of Eranad, which was a minor principality located in the northern parts of present-day Malappuram district. The Zamorin allied with Arab and Chinese merchants and used most of the wealth from Kozhikode to develop his military power. Kozhikode became the most powerful kingdom in the Malayalam speaking region during the Middle Ages. In the 14th century, Kozhikode conquered larger parts of central Kerala after the seize of Tirunavaya from Valluvanad, which were under the control of the king of Perumbadappu Swaroopam (Cochin). The ruler of Perumpadappu was forced to shift his capital (c. CE 1405) further south from Kodungallur to Kochi. In the 15th century, the status of Cochin was reduced to a vassal state of Kozhikode. The ruler of Kolathunadu (Kannur) had also came under the influence of Zamorin by the end of the 15th century.\nAt the peak of their reign, the Zamorins of Kozhikode ruled over a region from Kollam (Quilon) in the south to Panthalayini Kollam (Koyilandy) in the north. Ibn Battuta (1342\u20131347), who visited the city of Kozhikode six times, gives the earliest glimpses of life in the city. He describes Kozhikode as \"one of the great ports of the district of Malabar\" where \"merchants of all parts of the world are found\". The king of this place, he says, \"shaves his chin just as the Haidari Fakeers of Rome do... The greater part of the Muslim merchants of this place are so wealthy that one of them can purchase the whole freightage of such vessels put here and fit-out others like them\". Ma Huan (1403 AD), the Chinese sailor part of the Imperial Chinese fleet under Cheng Ho (Zheng He) states the city as a great emporium of trade frequented by merchants from around the world. He makes note of the 20 or 30 mosques built to cater to the religious needs of the Muslims, the unique system of calculation by the merchants using their fingers and toes (followed to this day), and the matrilineal system of succession (Marumakkathayam).

He defeated the Zamorin of Kozhikode, as well as the ruler of Kollam around 1443. Fern\u00e3o Nunes says that the Zamorin had to pay tribute to the king of Vijayanagara Empire. Later Kozhikode and Venad seem to have rebelled against their Vijayanagara overlords, but Deva Raya II quelled the rebellion. As the Vijayanagara power diminished over the next fifty years, the Zamorin of Kozhikode again rose to prominence in Kerala. He built a fort at Ponnani in 1498.\n\n\n=== Early modern period ===\nThe maritime spice trade monopoly in the Arabian Sea stayed with the Arabs during the High and Late Middle Ages. However, the dominance of Middle East traders was challenged in the European Age of Discovery. After Vasco Da Gama's arrival in Kappad Kozhikode in 1498, the Portuguese began to dominate eastern shipping, and the spice-trade in particular. Following the discovery of sea route from Europe to Malabar in 1498, the Portuguese began to expand their territories and ruled the seas between Ormus and the Malabar Coast and south to Ceylon. They established a trading centre at Tangasseri in Quilon during 1502 as per the invitation of the then Queen of Quilon to start spices trade from there. The Zamorin of Kozhikode permitted the new visitors to trade with his subjects such that Portuguese trade in Kozhikode prospered with the establishment of a factory and a fort. However, Portuguese attacks on Arab properties in his jurisdiction provoked the Zamorin and led to conflicts between them.\n\nThe ruler of the Kingdom of Tanur, who was a vassal to the Zamorin of Calicut, sided with the Portuguese, against his overlord at Kozhikode. As a result, the Kingdom of Tanur (Vettathunadu) became one of the earliest Portuguese Colonies in India. The ruler of Tanur also sided with Cochin. Many of the members of the royal family of Cochin in 16th and 17th centuries were selected from Vettom. However, the Tanur forces under the king fought for the Zamorin of Calicut in the Battle of Cochin (1504). However, the allegiance of the Mappila merchants in Tanur region still stayed under the Zamorin of Calicut.\nThe Portuguese took advantage of the rivalry between the Zamorin and the King of Kochi allied with Kochi. When Francisco de Almeida was appointed as Viceroy of Portuguese India in 1505, his headquarters was established at Fort Kochi (Fort Emmanuel) rather than in Kozhikode. During his reign, the Portuguese managed to dominate relations with Kochi and established a few fortresses on the Malabar Coast. Fort St Angelo or St. Angelo Fort was built at Kannur in 1505 and Fort St Thomas was built at Kollam (Quilon) in 1518 by the Portuguese. However, the Portuguese suffered setbacks from attacks by Zamorin forces in South Malabar; especially from naval attacks under the leadership of Kozhikode admirals known as Kunjali Marakkars, which compelled them to seek a treaty.

Tuhfat Ul Mujahideen written by Zainuddin Makhdoom II (born around 1532) of Ponnani in 16th-century CE is the first-ever known book fully based on the history of Kerala, written by a Keralite. It is written in Arabic and contains pieces of information about the resistance put up by the navy of Kunjali Marakkar alongside the Zamorin of Calicut from 1498 to 1583 against Portuguese attempts to colonise Malabar coast. Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan, who is considered as the father of modern Malayalam literature, was born at Tirur (Vettathunadu) during Portuguese period.In 1571, the Portuguese were defeated by the Zamorin forces in the battle at Chaliyam Fort. An insurrection at the Port of Quilon between the Arabs and the Portuguese led to the end of the Portuguese era in Quilon. The Muslim line of Ali Rajas of Arakkal kingdom, near Kannur, who were the vassals of the Kolathiri, ruled over the Lakshadweep islands. The Bekal Fort near Kasaragod, which is also largest fort in the state, was built in 1650 by Shivappa Nayaka of Keladi.\n\nIn 1602, the Zamorin sent messages to Aceh promising the Dutch a fort at Kozhikode if they would come and trade there. Two factors, Hans de Wolff and Lafer, were sent on an Asian ship from Aceh, but the two were captured by the chief of Tanur, and handed over to the Portuguese. A Dutch fleet under Admiral Steven van der Hagen arrived at Kozhikode in November 1604. It marked the beginning of the Dutch presence in Kerala and they concluded a treaty with Kozhikode on 11 November 1604, which was also the first treaty that the Dutch East India Company made with an Indian ruler. By this time the kingdom and the port of Kozhikode was much reduced in importance. The treaty provided for a mutual alliance between the two to expel the Portuguese from Malabar. In return the Dutch East India Company was given facilities for trade at Kozhikode and Ponnani, including spacious storehouses.The Portuguese were ousted by the Dutch East India Company, who during the conflicts between the Kozhikode and the Kochi, gained control of the trade. They lost to Dutch at Quilon after 1661 and later, the Portuguese left south-western coast. The arrival of British on Malabar Coast can be traced back to the year 1615, when a group under the leadership of Captain William Keeling arrived at Kozhikode, using three ships. It was in these ships that Sir Thomas Roe went to visit Jahangir, the fourth Mughal emperor, as British envoy.

An agreement, known as \"Treaty of Mavelikkara\", was signed by the Dutch and Travancore in 1753, according to which the Dutch were compelled to detach from all political involvement in the region. In the 18th Century, Travancore King Sree Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma annexed all the kingdoms up to Cochin through military conquests, resulting in the rise of Travancore to pre-eminence in Kerala. The Kochi ruler sued for peace with Anizham Thirunal and the northern and north-central parts of Kerala (Malabar District), along with Fort Kochi, Tangasseri, and Anchuthengu in southern Kerala, came under direct British rule until India became independent. Travancore became the dominant state in Kerala by defeating the powerful Zamorin of Kozhikode in the battle of Purakkad in 1755.\nThe island of Dharmadom near Kannur, along with Thalassery, was ceded to the East India Company in 1734, which were claimed by all of the Kolattu Rajas, Kottayam Rajas, and Arakkal Bibi in the late medieval period, where the British initiated a factory and English settlement following the cession. In 1761, the British captured Mah\u00e9, and the settlement was handed over to the ruler of Kadathanadu. The British restored Mah\u00e9 to the French as a part of the 1763 Treaty of Paris. In 1779, the Anglo-French war broke out, resulting in the French loss of Mah\u00e9. In 1783, the British agreed to restore to the French their settlements in India, and Mah\u00e9 was handed over to the French in 1785.\nIn 1757, to resist the invasion of the Zamorin of Kozhikode, the Palakkad Raja sought the help of the Hyder Ali of Mysore. In 1766, Hyder Ali defeated the Zamorin of Kozhikode \u2013 an East India Company ally at the time \u2013 and absorbed Kozhikode into his state. The smaller princely states in northern and north-central parts of Kerala (Malabar region) including Kolathunadu, Kottayam, Kadathanadu, Kozhikode, Tanur, Valluvanad, and Palakkad were unified under the rulers of Mysore and were made a part of the larger Kingdom of Mysore. His son and successor, Tipu Sultan, launched campaigns against the expanding British East India Company, resulting in two of the four Anglo-Mysore Wars. Tipu ultimately ceded the Malabar District and South Kanara to the company in the 1790s as a result of the Third Anglo-Mysore War and the subsequent Treaty of Seringapatam; both were annexed to the Bombay Presidency (which had also included other regions in the western coast of India) of British India in the years 1792 and 1799, respectively.", "start_char_idx": 30262, "end_char_idx": 33317, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e58cc3a-b220-45c4-8683-593bfd1f1725": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e58cc3a-b220-45c4-8683-593bfd1f1725", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Kerala.txt", "file_name": "Kerala.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 121009, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8305a4d4-9fba-4cf0-9d26-dc88545eccc1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Kerala.txt", "file_name": "Kerala.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 121009, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "b9c4f19f66c535c0cd324e82e05ffd64abf79b7d11b11ded8024fb6a0e60c2cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "99efbff5-e89d-456b-9915-fba5e2dd9081", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Kerala.txt", "file_name": "Kerala.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 121009, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "0dc5c1a54ff1a3f5385f9839042c3439cf5a6d2b20a4c025b7a579c99a34425c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "aa57138d-de21-4429-9844-69d056694b5c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9b555df1402d46571198216d86c79fc0e7aef0dd2f7b1dbc8a0b570133aec648", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Later in 1800, both of the Malabar District and South Canara were separated from Bombay presidency to merge them with the neighbouring Madras Presidency. The company forged tributary alliances with Kochi in 1791 and Travancore in 1795.By the end of the 18th century, the whole of Kerala fell under the control of the British, either administered directly or under suzerainty. Initially the British had to suffer local resistance against their rule under the leadership of Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja, who had popular support in Thalassery-Wayanad region. The municipalities of Kozhikode, Palakkad, Fort Kochi, Kannur, and Thalassery, were founded on 1 November 1866 of the British Indian Empire, making them the first modern municipalities in the state of Kerala. The Malabar Special Police was formed by the colonial government in 1884 headquartered at Malappuram.There were major revolts in Kerala during the independence movement in the 20th century; most notable among them is the 1921 Malabar Rebellion and the social struggles in Travancore. In the Malabar Rebellion, Mappila Muslims of Malabar rebelled against the British Raj. The Battle of Pookkottur adorns an important role in the rebellion. Some social struggles against caste inequalities also erupted in the early decades of the 20th century, leading to the 1936 Temple Entry Proclamation by Travancore Maharaja Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma that opened Hindu temples in Travancore to all castes.\n\n\n=== As a state of the Republic of India ===\nAfter India was partitioned in 1947 into India and Pakistan, Travancore and Kochi, part of the Union of India were merged on 1 July 1949 to form Travancore-Cochin. On 1 November 1956, the taluk of Kasargod in the South Kanara district of Madras, the Malabar district of Madras (excluding the islands of Lakshadweep), and Travancore-Cochin, without four southern taluks and Sengottai taluk (which joined Tamil Nadu), merged to form the state of Kerala under the States Reorganisation Act. A Communist-led government under E. M. S. Namboodiripad resulted from the first elections for the new Kerala Legislative Assembly in 1957. It was one of the earliest elected Communist governments anywhere. His government implemented land and educational reforms which in turn, reduced income inequality in the state.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe state is wedged between the Lakshadweep Sea and the Western Ghats. Lying between northern latitudes 8\u00b018' and 12\u00b048' and eastern longitudes 74\u00b052' and 77\u00b022', Kerala experiences humid tropical rainforest climate with some cyclones.

Around 65% of the rainfall occurs from June to August corresponding to the Southwest monsoon, and the rest from September to December corresponding to Northeast monsoon. The moisture-laden winds of the Southwest monsoon, on reaching the southernmost point of the Indian Peninsula, because of its topography, divides into two branches; the \"Arabian Sea Branch\" and the \"Bay of Bengal Branch\". The \"Arabian Sea Branch\" of the Southwest monsoon first hits the Western Ghats, making Kerala the first state in India to receive rain from the Southwest monsoon. The distribution of pressure patterns is reversed in the Northeast monsoon, during this season the cold winds from North India pick up moisture from the Bay of Bengal and precipitate it on the east coast of peninsular India. In Kerala, the influence of the Northeast monsoon is seen in southern districts only. Kerala's rainfall averages 2,923 mm (115 in) annually. Some of Kerala's drier lowland regions average only 1,250 mm (49 in); the mountains of the eastern Idukki district receive more than 5,000 mm (197 in) of orographic precipitation: the highest in the state. In eastern Kerala, a drier tropical wet and dry climate prevails.

Auxiliary authorities known as panchayats, for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs. The judiciary consists of the Kerala High Court and a system of lower courts. The High Court, located in Kochi, has a Chief Justice along with 35 permanent and twelve additional pro tempore justices as of 2021. The high court also hears cases from the Union Territory of Lakshadweep.In Kerala, local government bodies such as Panchayats, Municipalities, and Corporations have existed since 1959. However, a significant decentralization initiative began in 1993, aligning with constitutional amendments by the central government. The Kerala Panchayati Raj Act and Kerala Municipality Act were enacted in 1994, establishing a 3-tier system for local governance. This system includes Gram Panchayat, Block Panchayat, and District Panchayat. The Acts define clear powers for these institutions. For urban areas, the Kerala Municipality Act follows a single-tier system, equivalent to Gram Panchayat.These bodies receive substantial administrative, legal, and financial powers to ensure effective decentralization. Currently, the state government allocates around 40% of the state plan outlay to local governments. Kerala was declared the first digital state of India in 2016 and, according to the India Corruption Survey 2019 by Transparency International, is considered the least corrupt state in India. The Public Affairs Index-2020 designated Kerala as the best-governed state in India.Kerala hosts two major political alliances: the United Democratic Front (UDF), led by the Indian National Congress; and the Left Democratic Front (LDF), led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)). As of 2021 Kerala Legislative Assembly election, the LDF is the ruling coalition; Pinarayi Vijayan of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is the Chief Minister, while V. D. Satheesan of the Indian National Congress is the Leader of the Opposition. According to the Constitution of India, Kerala has a parliamentary system of representative democracy; universal suffrage is granted to residents.", "start_char_idx": 46813, "end_char_idx": 50737, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "071ff15a-d0ad-4947-91a0-b4d39ec610c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "071ff15a-d0ad-4947-91a0-b4d39ec610c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Kerala.txt", "file_name": "Kerala.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 121009, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8305a4d4-9fba-4cf0-9d26-dc88545eccc1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Kerala.txt", "file_name": "Kerala.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 121009, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "b9c4f19f66c535c0cd324e82e05ffd64abf79b7d11b11ded8024fb6a0e60c2cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7ef8dd42-4dc1-47d2-9104-89b04eb746ef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Kerala.txt", "file_name": "Kerala.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 121009, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "ba39e7894cf96fa688fc2df00e1df5eb1e748dd10c8c9c97d64fd4c2289f9741", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5af4b1f1-c5d4-4275-94f6-3940c9560191", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "172454eaa762215e9daa8ed61c4ef691c26b445814a01bca9f0301dfcd823ffc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Economy ==\n\nAfter independence, the state was managed as a social democratic welfare economy. From the 1990s, liberalisation of the mixed economy allowed Licence Raj restrictions against capitalism and foreign direct investment to be lightened, leading to economic expansion and an increase in employment. In the fiscal year 2018\u201319, the nominal gross state domestic product (GSDP) was \u20b97.82 lakh crore (US$98 billion). GSDP growth; 11.4% in 2018\u20132019 and 10.5% in 2017\u20132018 had been high compared to an average of 2.3% annually in the 1980s and between 5.1%:\u200a8\u200a and 6.0% in the 1990s.:\u200a8\u200a The state recorded 8.9% growth in enterprises from 1998 to 2005, higher than the national rate of 4.8%. The \"Kerala phenomenon\" or \"Kerala model of development\" of very high human development and in comparison low economic development has resulted from a strong service sector.:\u200a48\u200a:\u200a1\u200a In 2019\u201320, the tertiary sector contributed around 63% of the state's GSVA, compared to 28% by secondary sector, and 8% by primary sector. In the period between 1960 and 2020, Kerala's economy was gradually shifting from an agrarian economy into a service-based one.\n\nThe state's service sector which accounts for around 63% of its revenue is mainly based upon hospitality industry, tourism, Ayurveda and medical services, pilgrimage, information technology, transportation, financial sector, and education. Major initiatives under the industrial sector include Cochin Shipyard, shipbuilding, oil refinery, software industry, coastal mineral industries, food processing, marine products processing, and Rubber based products. The primary sector of the state is mainly based upon cash crops. Kerala produces a significant amount of national output of the cash crops such as coconut, tea, coffee, pepper, natural rubber, cardamom, and cashew in India. The cultivation of food crops began to reduce since the 1950s. The migrant labourers in Kerala are a significant workforce in its industrial and agricultural sectors. Being home to only 1.18% of the total land area of India and 2.75% of its population, Kerala contributes more than 4% to the gross domestic product of India.\nKerala's economy depends significantly on emigrants working in foreign countries, mainly in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, and the remittances annually contribute more than a fifth of GSDP. The state witnessed significant emigration during the Gulf Boom of the 1970s and early 1980s. In 2008, the Persian Gulf countries together had a Keralite population of more than 2.5 million, who sent home annually a sum of US$6.81 billion, which is the highest among Indian states and more than 15.1% of remittances to India in 2008. In 2012, Kerala still received the highest remittances of all states: US$11.3 billion, which was nearly 16% of the US$71 billion remittances to the country. In 2015, NRI deposits in Kerala have soared to over \u20b91 lakh crore (US$13 billion), amounting to one-sixth of all the money deposited in NRI accounts, which comes to about \u20b97 lakh crore (US$88 billion).

Consequently, investment in rice production decreased and a major portion of the land shifted to the cultivation of perennial tree crops and seasonal crops. Profitability of crops fell due to a shortage of farm labour, the high price of land, and the uneconomic size of operational holdings. Only 27.3% of the families in Kerala depend upon agriculture for their livelihood, which is also the least curresponding rate in India.Kerala produces 97% of the national output of black pepper and accounts for 85% of the natural rubber in the country. Coconut, tea, coffee, cashew, and spices\u2014including cardamom, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg are the main agricultural products.:\u200a74\u200a Around 80% of India's export quality cashew kernels are prepared in Kollam. The key cash crop is Coconut and Kerala ranks first in the area of coconut cultivation in India. In 1960\u201361, about 70% of the Coconuts produced in India were from Kerala, which have reduced to 42% in 2011\u201312. Around 90% of the total Cardamom produced in India is from Kerala. India is the second-largest producer of Cardamom in world. About 20% of the total Coffee produced in India are from Kerala. The key agricultural staple is rice, with varieties grown in extensive paddy fields. Home gardens made up a significant portion of the agricultural sector. Related animal husbandry is touted by proponents as a means of alleviating rural poverty and unemployment among women, the marginalised, and the landless. The state government promotes these activities via educational campaigns and the development of new cattle breeds such as the Sunandini.\nThough the contribution of the agricultural sector to the state economy was on the decline in 2012\u201313, through the strength of the allied livestock sector, it has picked up from 7.0% (2011\u201312) to 7.2%. In the 2013\u201314 fiscal period, the contribution has been estimated at a high of 7.8%. The total growth of the farm sector has recorded a 4.4% increase in 2012\u201313, over a 1.3% growth in the previous fiscal year. The agricultural sector has a share of 9.3% in the sectoral distribution of Gross State Domestic Product at Constant Price, while the secondary and tertiary sectors have contributed 23.9% and 66.7%, respectively.There is a preference for organic products and home farming compared to synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.

According to 2003\u201304 reports, about 11 lakh(1.1 million) people earn their livelihood from fishing and allied activities such as drying, processing, packaging, exporting and transporting fisheries. The annual yield of the sector was estimated as 6,08,000 tons in 2003\u201304. This contributes to about 3% of the total economy of the state. In 2006, around 22% of the total Indian marine fishery yield was from Kerala. During the southwest monsoon, a suspended mud bank develops along the shore, which in turn leads to calm ocean water, peaking the output of the fishing industry. This phenomenon is locally called chakara. The waters provide a large variety of fish: pelagic species; 59%, demersal species; 23%, crustaceans, molluscs and others for 18%. Around 1050,000(1.050 million) fishermen haul an annual catch of 668,000 tonnes as of a 1999\u20132000 estimate; 222 fishing villages are strung along the 590-kilometre (370-mile) coast.

This translates to about 9.94 kilometres (6.18 mi) of road per thousand people, compared to an average of 4.87 kilometres (3.03 mi) in the country. Roads in Kerala include 1,812 kilometres (1,126 mi) of national highway; 1.6% of the nation's total, 4,342 kilometres (2,698 mi) of state highway; 2.5% of the nation's total, 27,470 kilometres (17,070 mi) of district roads; 4.7% of the nation's total, 33,201 kilometres (20,630 mi) of urban (municipal) roads; 6.3% of the nation's total, and 158,775 kilometres (98,658 mi) of rural roads; 3.8% of the nation's total. Kottayam has the maximum length of roads among the districts of Kerala, while Wayanad accounts for minimum. Most of Kerala's west coast is accessible through the NH 66 (previously NH 17 and 47); and the eastern side is accessible through state highways. New projects for hill and coastal highways were recently announced under KIIFB. National Highway 66, with the longest stretch of road (1,622 kilometres (1,008 mi)) connects Kanyakumari to Mumbai; it enters Kerala via Talapady in Kasargod and passes through Kannur, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Guruvayur, Kochi, Alappuzha, Kollam, Thiruvananthapuram before entering Tamil Nadu. Palakkad district is generally referred to as the Gateway of Kerala, due to the presence of the Palakkad Gap in the Western Ghats, through which the northern (Malabar) and southern (Travancore) parts of Kerala are connected to the rest of India via road and rail. The state's largest checkpoint, Walayar, is on NH 544, in the border town between Kerala and Tamil Nadu, through which a large amount of public and commercial transportation reaches the northern and central districts of Kerala.\nThe Department of Public Works is responsible for maintaining and expanding the state highways system and major district roads. The Kerala State Transport Project (KSTP), which includes the GIS-based Road Information and Management Project (RIMS), is responsible for maintaining and expanding the state highways in Kerala. It also oversees a few major district roads. Traffic in Kerala has been growing at a rate of 10\u201311% every year, resulting in high traffic and pressure on the roads. Traffic density is nearly four times the national average, reflecting the state's high population. Kerala's annual total of road accidents is among the nation's highest. The accidents are mainly the result of the narrow roads and irresponsible driving. National Highways in Kerala are among the narrowest in the country and will remain so for the foreseeable future, as the state government has received an exemption that allows narrow national highways. In Kerala, highways are 45 metres (148 feet) wide. In other states, national highways are grade separated, 60 metres (200 feet) wide with a minimum of four lanes, as well as 6 or 8-lane access-controlled expressways. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has threatened the Kerala state government that it will give higher priority to other states in highway development since political commitment to better highways in Kerala has been lacking. As of 2013, Kerala had the highest road accident rate in the country, with most fatal accidents taking place along the state's national highways.", "start_char_idx": 62996, "end_char_idx": 66355, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd8ee0f6-5416-4fa4-a19b-8878b2fb1ba1": {"__data__": {"id_": "cd8ee0f6-5416-4fa4-a19b-8878b2fb1ba1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Kerala.txt", "file_name": "Kerala.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 121009, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8305a4d4-9fba-4cf0-9d26-dc88545eccc1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Kerala.txt", "file_name": "Kerala.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 121009, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "b9c4f19f66c535c0cd324e82e05ffd64abf79b7d11b11ded8024fb6a0e60c2cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b31c6067-6288-47ee-9302-6dad1b10d2d3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Kerala.txt", "file_name": "Kerala.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 121009, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "f1efa7e7c6ff9d54bc36b6f63cd712aa15fa7efe9793cdf480057f0d774f98ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e2df702-d531-47b8-8877-e4bf5202a1d2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f5a07c4a2e6c959ff0706f8c2203ad63e90e1d7fcbe25756a6aa8aa0628aac29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "==== Kerala State Road Transport Corporation ====\n\nKerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) is a state-owned road transport corporation.

Other intermediate ports include Beypore, Kollam, and Azheekal. The remaining ports are classified as minor which include Manjeshwaram, Kasaragod, Nileshwaram, Kannur, Thalassery, Vadakara, Ponnani, Munambam, Manakodam, Alappuzha, Kayamkulam, Neendakara, and Valiyathura. The Kerala Maritime Institute is headquartered at Neendakara, which has an additional subcentre at Kodungallur too. The state has numerous backwaters, which are used for commercial inland navigation. Transport services are mainly provided by country craft and passenger vessels. There are 67 navigable rivers in the state while the total length of inland waterways is 1,687 kilometres (1,048 mi). The main constraints to the expansion of inland navigation are; lack of depth in waterways caused by silting, lack of maintenance of navigation systems and bank protection, accelerated growth of the water hyacinth, lack of modern inland craft terminals, and lack of a cargo handling system.\nThe 616 kilometres (383 mi) long West-Coast Canal is the longest waterway in state connecting Kasaragod to Poovar.

The Conolly Canal, which is a part of West-Coast Canal, connects the city of Kozhikode with Kochi through Ponnani, passing through the districts of Malappuram and Thrissur. It begins at Vadakara. It was constructed in the year 1848 under the orders of then District collector of Malabar, H. V. Conolly, initially to facilitate movement of goods to Kallayi Port from hinter lands of Malabar through Kuttiady and Korapuzha river systems. It was the main waterway for the cargo movement between Kozhikode and Kochi through Ponnani, for more than a century.

As of 2011, Thiruvananthapuram is the most populous city in Kerala. In the state, the rate of population growth is India's lowest, and the decadal growth of 4.9% in 2011 is less than one third of the all-India average of 17.6%. Kerala's population more than doubled between 1951 and 1991 by adding 15.6 million people to reach 29.1 million residents in 1991; the population stood at 33.3 million by 2011. Kerala's coastal regions are the most densely settled with population of 2022 persons per km2, 2.5 times the overall population density of the state, 859 persons per km2, leaving the eastern hills and mountains comparatively sparsely populated. Kerala is the second-most urbanised major state in the country with 47.7% urban population according to the 2011 Census of India. Around 31.8 million Keralites are predominantly Malayali.

As a result, women in Kerala have had a much higher standing and influence in the society. This was common among certain influential castes and is a factor in the value placed on daughters. Christian missionaries also influenced Malayali women in that they started schools for girls from poor families. Opportunities for women such as education and gainful employment often translate into a lower birth rate, which in turn, make education and employment more likely to be accessible and more beneficial for women. This creates an upward spiral for both the women and children of the community that is passed on to future generations. According to the Human Development Report of 1996, Kerala's Gender Development Index was 597; higher than any other state of India. Factors, such as high rates of female literacy, education, work participation and life expectancy, along with favourable sex ratio, contributed to it.Kerala's sex ratio of 1.084 (females to males) is higher than that of the rest of India; it is the only state where women outnumber men.:\u200a2\u200a While having the opportunities that education affords them, such as political participation, keeping up to date with current events, reading religious texts etc., these tools have still not translated into full, equal rights for the women of Kerala.

Kerala is one of the first states in India to form a welfare policy for the transgender community. In 2016, the Kerala government introduced free sex reassignment surgery through government hospitals. Queerala is one of the major LGBT organisations in Kerala. It campaigns for increased awareness of LGBT people and sensitisation concerning healthcare services, workplace policies and educational curriculum. Since 2010, Kerala Queer Pride has been held annually across various cities in Kerala.In June 2019, the Kerala government passed a new order that members of the transgender community should not be referred to as the \"third gender\" or \"other gender\" in government communications. Instead, the term \"transgender\" should be used. Previously, the gender preferences provided in government forms and documents included male, female, and other/third gender.In the 2021 Mathrubhumi Youth Manifesto Survey conducted on people aged between 15 and 35, majority (74.3%) of the respondents supported legislation for same-sex marriage while 25.7% opposed it.\n\n\n=== Human Development Index ===\n\nUnder a democratic communist local government, Kerala has achieved a record of social development much more advanced than the Indian average. As of 2015, Kerala has a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.770, which is in the \"high\" category, ranking it first in the country. It was 0.790 in 2007\u201308 and it had a consumption-based HDI of 0.920, which is better than that of many developed countries. Comparatively higher spending by the government on primary level education, health care and the elimination of poverty from the 19th century onwards has helped the state maintain an exceptionally high HDI; the report was prepared by the central government's Institute of Applied Manpower Research. However, the Human Development Report 2005, prepared by Centre for Development Studies envisages a virtuous phase of inclusive development for the state since the advancement in human development had already started aiding the economic development of the state. Kerala is also widely regarded as the cleanest and healthiest state in India.According to the 2011 census, Kerala has the highest literacy rate (94%) among Indian states. In 2018, the literacy rate was calculated to be 96%. In the Kottayam district, the literacy rate was 97%. The life expectancy in Kerala is 74 years, among the highest in India as of 2011. Kerala's rural poverty rate fell from 59% (1973\u20131974) to 12% (1999\u20132010); the overall (urban and rural) rate fell 47% between the 1970s and 2000s against the 29% fall in overall poverty rate in India. By 1999\u20132000, the rural and urban poverty rates dropped to 10.0% and 9.6%, respectively. The 2013 Tendulkar Committee Report on poverty estimated that the percentages of the population living below the poverty line in rural and urban Kerala are 9.1% and 5.0%, respectively. These changes stem largely from efforts begun in the late 19th century by the kingdoms of Cochin and Travancore to boost social welfare.

Hinduism is the most widely professed faith in Kerala, with significant Muslim and Christian minorities. In comparison with the rest of India, Kerala experiences relatively little sectarianism. According to 2011 Census of India figures, 54.7% of Kerala's residents are Hindus, 26.6% are Muslims, 18.4% are Christians, and the remaining 0.3% follow another religion or have no religious affiliation. Hindus represent the biggest religious group in all districts except Malappuram, where they are outnumbered by Muslims. Kerala has the largest population of Christians in India. As of 2016, Hindus, Muslims, Christians and others account for 41.9%, 42.6%, 15.4% and 0.2% of the total child births in the state, respectively.The mythological legends regarding the origin of Kerala are Hindu in nature. Kerala produced several saints and movements. Adi Shankara was a religious philosopher who contributed to Hinduism and propagated the philosophy of Advaita. He was instrumental in establishing four mathas at Sringeri, Dwarka, Puri and Jyotirmath. Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri was another religious figure who composed Narayaniyam, a collection of verses in praise of the Hindu God Krishna.\nIslam arrived in Kerala, a part of the larger Indian Ocean rim, via spice and silk traders from the Middle East. Historians do not rule out the possibility of Islam being introduced to Kerala as early as the seventh century CE. Notable has been the occurrence of Cheraman Perumal Tajuddin, the mythical Hindu king that moved to Arabia to meet the Islamic Prophet Muhammad and converted to Islam. Kerala Muslims are generally referred to as the Mappilas. Mappilas are but one among the many communities that forms the Muslim population of Kerala. According to the Legend of Cheraman Perumals, the first Indian mosque was built in 624 CE at Kodungallur with the mandate of the last the ruler (the Cheraman Perumal) of Chera dynasty, who converted to Islam during the lifetime of Prophet Muhammad (c.\u2009570\u2013632). According to Qissat Shakarwati Farmad, the Masjids at Kodungallur, Kollam, Madayi, Barkur, Mangalore, Kasaragod, Kannur, Dharmadam, Panthalayini, and Chaliyam, were built during the era of Malik Dinar, and they are among the oldest Masjids in the Indian subcontinent. It is believed that Malik Dinar died at Thalangara in Kasaragod town. According to popular tradition, Islam was brought to Lakshadweep islands, on the western side of Kerala, by Ubaidullah in 661 CE. His grave is believed to be located on the island of Andrott.", "start_char_idx": 85635, "end_char_idx": 88837, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08d49e0c-d938-4873-b6b2-87846460e89d": {"__data__": {"id_": "08d49e0c-d938-4873-b6b2-87846460e89d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Kerala.txt", "file_name": "Kerala.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 121009, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8305a4d4-9fba-4cf0-9d26-dc88545eccc1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Kerala.txt", "file_name": "Kerala.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 121009, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "b9c4f19f66c535c0cd324e82e05ffd64abf79b7d11b11ded8024fb6a0e60c2cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f2ed6beb-5455-4fae-9fe0-9f640d2e818e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Kerala.txt", "file_name": "Kerala.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 121009, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "7ed80b052fff7ed28cd8b292bbc26de89579efd83120e79150f2f38dd7affdfc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dd10c581-4eee-4226-9d4b-6e6606820106", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9ace6cb3f5251fd7af9880e7bd341058ab1c9d78a4ba7a04c8f09edbc165f923", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It is believed that Malik Dinar died at Thalangara in Kasaragod town. According to popular tradition, Islam was brought to Lakshadweep islands, on the western side of Kerala, by Ubaidullah in 661 CE. His grave is believed to be located on the island of Andrott. A few Umayyad (661\u2013750 CE) coins were discovered from Kothamangalam in the eastern part of Ernakulam district.According to some scholars, the Mappilas are the oldest settled Muslim community in South Asia. The monopoly of overseas spice trade from Malabar Coast was safe with the West Asian shipping magnates of Kerala ports. The Muslims were a major financial power to be reckoned within the kingdoms of Kerala and had great political influence in the Hindu royal courts. The Koyilandy Jumu'ah Mosque contains an Old Malayalam inscription written in a mixture of Vatteluttu and Grantha scripts which dates back to the 10th century CE. It is a rare surviving document recording patronage by a Kerala king to the Muslims of Kerala. A 13th century granite inscription, written in a mixture of Old Malayalam and Arabic, at Muchundi Mosque in Kozhikode mentions a donation by the king to the mosque. Travellers have recorded the considerably huge presence of Muslim merchants and settlements of sojourning traders in most of the ports of Kerala. Immigration, intermarriage and missionary activity/conversion\u2014secured by the common interest in the spice trade\u2014helped in this development. Most of the Muslims in Kerala follow the Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b school of religious law (Samastha Kerala Jamiat-ul-Ulema) while a large minority follow movements that developed within Sunni Islam. The latter section consists of majority Salafists (Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen). There is a large Keralan diaspora in the Middle East.Ancient Christian tradition says that Christianity reached the shores of Kerala in 52 CE with the arrival of Thomas the Apostle, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ. Saint Thomas Christians include Syro-Malabar Catholic, Syro-Malankara Catholic, Jacobite Syrian Christian Church, Mar Thoma Syrian Church, Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Syrian Anglicans of the CSI and Pentecostal Saint Thomas Christians. The origin of the Latin Catholic Christians in Kerala is the result of the missionary endeavours of the Portuguese Padroado in the 16th century. As a consequence of centuries of mixing with colonial immigrants, beginning with the Portuguese, Dutch, French, British and other Europeans, there is a community of Anglo-Indians in Kerala of mixed European and Indian parentage or ancestry. Kerala has the highest population of Christians among all the states of India.Judaism reached Kerala in the 10th century BCE during the time of King Solomon. They are called Cochin Jews or Malabar Jews and are the oldest group of Jews in India. There was a significant Jewish community which existed in Kerala until the 20th century, when most of them migrated to Israel. The Paradesi Synagogue at Kochi is the oldest synagogue in the Commonwealth. Jainism has a considerable following in the Wayanad district.Buddhism was popular in the time of Ashoka but vanished by the 12th century CE.

Owing to the former matrilineal system, women in Kerala enjoy a high social status. However, gender inequality among low caste men and women is reportedly higher compared to that in other castes.:\u200a1\u200a\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries. In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school independently created a number of important mathematics concepts, including series expansion for trigonometric functions. The Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics was based at Vettathunadu (Tirur region). In the early decades of the 19th century, the modern educational transformation of Kerala was triggered by the efforts of the Church Mission Society missionaries to promote mass education. Following the recommendations of the Wood's despatch of 1854, the princely states of Travancore and Cochin launched mass education drives mainly based on castes and communities, and introduced a system of grant-in-aid to attract more private initiatives. The efforts by leaders such as Vaikunda Swami, Narayana Guru, Ayyankali, and Kuriakose Elias Chavara in aiding the socially discriminated castes in the state\u2014with the help of community-based organisations like Nair Service Society, SNDP, Muslim Educational Society, Muslim Mahajana Sabha, Yoga Kshema Sabha (of Nambudiris) and congregations of Christian churches\u2014led to the further development of mass education in Kerala.According to the first economic census, conducted in 1977, 99.7% of the villages in Kerala had a primary school within 2 kilometres (1.2 mi), 98.6% had a middle school within 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) and 96.7% had a high school or higher secondary school within 5 kilometres (3.1 mi).:\u200a62\u200a In 1991, Kerala became the first state in India to be recognised as completely literate, although the effective literacy rate at that time was only 90%. In 2006\u20132007, the state topped the Education Development Index (EDI) of the 21 major states in India. As of 2007, enrolment in elementary education was almost 100%; and, unlike other states in India, educational opportunity was almost equally distributed among sexes, social groups, and regions. According to the 2011 census, Kerala has a 93.9% literacy, compared to the national literacy rate of 74.0%. In January 2016, Kerala became the first Indian state to achieve 100% primary education through its Athulyam literacy programme.The educational system prevailing in the state's schools specifies an initial 10-year course of study, which is divided into three stages: lower primary, upper primary, and secondary school\u2014known as 4+3+3, which signifies the number of years for each stage. After the first 10 years of schooling, students typically enroll in Higher Secondary Schooling in one of the three major streams\u2014liberal arts, commerce, or science.

There are 15,892 schools under KBPE, of which 5,986 are government schools, 8,183 are aided schools, and the rest are either un-aided or technical schools. Other educational boards are the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE), the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), and the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS). English is the language of instruction in most self-financing schools, while government and government-aided schools offer instruction in English or Malayalam. Though the cost of education is generally considered low in Kerala, according to the 61st round of the National Sample Survey (2004\u20132005), per capita spending on education by the rural households was reported to be \u20b941 (51\u00a2 US) for Kerala, more than twice the national average. The survey also revealed that the rural-urban difference in household expenditure on education was much less in Kerala than in the rest of India.CMS College, Kottayam, established in 1817, is the first western-style college, and one of the oldest colleges, in India. Government Brennen College, Thalassery, founded by philanthropist Edward Brennen in 1862, and Government Victoria College, Palakkad, founded in 1866, are among the oldest educational institutions in India.\nThe KITE Kerala is a state owned special purpose company under education department of the Government of Kerala. It was developed to support ICT enabled education for schools in the state. The erstwhile IT@School Project was transformed into KITE for extending its scope of operations in August 2017. Kerala is the first Indian state to have ICT-enabled education with hi-tech classrooms in all public schools. Kerala topped in the School Education Quality Index published by NITI Aayog in 2019.The Indian Naval Academy, located at Ezhimala, is Asia's largest, and the world's third-largest, naval academy.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe culture of Kerala is composite and cosmopolitan in nature and it is an integral part of Indian culture. It is a synthesis of Aryan, Dravidian, Arab, and European cultures, developed over millennia, under influences from other parts of India and abroad. It is defined by its antiquity and the organic continuity sustained by the Malayali people. It was elaborated through centuries of contact with neighbouring and overseas cultures. However, the geographical insularity of Kerala from the rest of the country has resulted in the development of a distinctive lifestyle, art, architecture, language, literature and social institutions. Over 10,000 festivals are celebrated in the state every year. The Malayalam calendar, a solar sidereal calendar started from 825 CE in Kerala, finds common usage in planning agricultural and religious activities.

A common characteristic of these festivals is the hoisting of a holy flag which is brought down on the final day of the festival after immersing the deity. Some festivals include Poorams, the best known of these being the Thrissur Pooram. \"Elephants, firework displays and huge crowds\" are the major attractions of Thrissur Pooram. Other known festivals are Makaravilakku, Chinakkathoor Pooram, Attukal Pongala and Nenmara Vallangi Vela Other than these, festivals locally known as utsavams are conducted by many temples mostly on annual basis. Temples that can afford it will usually involve at least one richly caparisoned elephant as part of the festivities. The idol in the temple is taken out on a procession around the countryside atop this elephant. When the procession visits homes around the temple, people will usually present rice, coconuts, and other offerings to it. Processions often include traditional music such as Panchari melam or Panchavadyam. Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha are celebrated by the Muslim community of the state while the festivals like Christmas and Easter are observed by the Christians.Onam is a harvest festival celebrated by the people of Kerala and is reminiscent of the state's agrarian past. It is a local festival of Kerala consisting of a four-day public holidays; from Onam Eve (Uthradam) to the fourth Onam Day.

These include five classical dance forms: Kathakali, Mohiniyattam, Koodiyattom, Thullal and Krishnanattam, which originated and developed in the temple theatres during the classical period under the patronage of royal houses. Kerala natanam, Thirayattam, Kaliyattam, Theyyam, Koothu and Padayani are other dance forms associated with the temple culture of the region. Some traditional dance forms such as Oppana and Duffmuttu were popular among the Muslims of the state, while Margamkali and Parichamuttukali are popular among the Syrian Christians and Chavittu nadakom is popular among the Latin Christians. The development of classical music in Kerala is attributed to the contributions it received from the traditional performance arts associated with the temple culture of Kerala. The development of the indigenous classical music form, Sopana Sangeetham, illustrates the rich contribution that temple culture has made to the arts of Kerala. Carnatic music dominates Keralite traditional music. This was the result of Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma's popularisation of the genre in the 19th century. Raga-based renditions known as sopanam accompany kathakali performances. Melam; including the paandi and panchari variants, is a more percussive style of music: it is performed at Kshetram-centered festivals using the chenda. Panchavadyam is a form of percussion ensemble, in which artists use five types of percussion instrument. Kerala's visual arts range from traditional murals to the works of Raja Ravi Varma, the state's most renowned painter. Most of the castes and communities in Kerala have rich collections of folk songs and ballads associated with a variety of themes; Vadakkan Pattukal (Northern Ballads), Thekkan pattukal (Southern Ballads), Vanchi pattukal (Boat Songs), Mappila Pattukal (Muslim songs) and Pallipattukal (Church songs) are a few of them.", "start_char_idx": 99978, "end_char_idx": 101919, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36f7efc5-ee43-4c66-9f87-0529a23250f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "36f7efc5-ee43-4c66-9f87-0529a23250f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Kerala.txt", "file_name": "Kerala.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 121009, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8305a4d4-9fba-4cf0-9d26-dc88545eccc1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Kerala.txt", "file_name": "Kerala.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 121009, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "b9c4f19f66c535c0cd324e82e05ffd64abf79b7d11b11ded8024fb6a0e60c2cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "22f0e116-f90b-4184-9e3f-49157a40efc8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Kerala.txt", "file_name": "Kerala.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 121009, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "2fd42d050601838a9485b85d0610d68c94180a56fb6eeab3d17184053f3d74e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b64c8169-aa50-4c1f-aae9-ae23bba26206", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "963f16a56baef924713808404be05432a1f7c6a93e8dc46fa059db6a5767e9b8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Cinema ===\n\nMalayalam films carved a niche for themselves in the Indian film industry with the presentation of social themes.

Malayalam literature starts from the Old Malayalam period (9th\u201313th century CE) and includes such notable writers as the 14th-century Niranam poets (Madhava Panikkar, Sankara Panikkar and Rama Panikkar), and the 16th-century poet Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan, whose works mark the dawn of both the modern Malayalam language and its poetry. For the first 600 years of Malayalam calendar, the literature mainly consisted of the oral Ballads such as Vadakkan Pattukal in North Malabar and Thekkan Pattukal in Southern Travancore. Designated a \"Classical Language in India\" in 2013, it developed into the current form mainly by the influence of the poets Cherusseri Namboothiri, Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan, and Poonthanam Nambudiri, in the 15th and the 16th centuries of Common Era. Unnayi Variyar, a probable poet of the 17th/18th century CE, and Kunchan Nambiar, a poet of the 18th century CE, have also influenced a lot in the growth of modern Malayalam literature in its pre-mature form. The Bharathappuzha river, also known as River Ponnani, and its tributaries, have played a major role in the development of modern Malayalam Literature.Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar and Kerala Varma Valiakoi Thampuran are noted for their contribution to Malayalam prose. The \"triumvirate of poets\" (Kavithrayam): Kumaran Asan, Vallathol Narayana Menon, and Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer, are recognised for moving Keralite poetry away from archaic sophistry and metaphysics, and towards a more lyrical mode. The poets like Moyinkutty Vaidyar and Pulikkottil Hyder have made notable contributions to the Mappila songs, which is a genre of the Arabi Malayalam literature. The first travelogue in any Indian language is the Malayalam Varthamanappusthakam, written by Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar in 1785. The prose literature, Malayalam journalism, and criticism began after the latter-half of the 18th century. Contemporary Malayalam literature deals with social, political, and economic life context. The tendency of the modern literature is often towards political radicalism. Malayalam literature has been presented with 6 Jnanapith awards, the second-most for any Dravidian language and the third-highest for any Indian language. In the second half of the 20th century, Jnanpith winning poets and writers like G. Sankara Kurup, S. K. Pottekkatt, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, M. T. Vasudevan Nair, O. N. V. Kurup, and Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri, had made valuable contributions to the modern Malayalam literature. Later, writers like O. V. Vijayan, Kamaladas, M.

In 2012, National Geographic's Traveller magazine named Kerala as one of the \"ten paradises of the world\" and \"50 must see destinations of a lifetime\". Travel and Leisure also described Kerala as \"One of the 100 great trips for the 21st century\". In 2012, it overtook the Taj Mahal to be the number one travel destination in Google's search trends for India. CNN Travel listed Kerala among its '19 best places to visit in 2019'. Kerala was named by TIME magazine in 2022 among the 50 extraordinary destinations to explore in its list of the World's Greatest Places.Kerala's beaches, backwaters, lakes, mountain ranges, waterfalls, ancient ports, palaces, religious institutions and wildlife sanctuaries are major attractions for both domestic and international tourists. The city of Kochi ranks first in the total number of international and domestic tourists in Kerala. Until the early 1980s, Kerala was a relatively unknown destination compared to other states in the country. In 1986 the government of Kerala declared tourism an important industry and it was the first state in India to do so. Marketing campaigns launched by the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation, the government agency that oversees the tourism prospects of the state, resulted in the growth of the tourism industry. Many advertisements branded Kerala with the tagline Kerala, God's Own Country. Kerala tourism is a global brand and regarded as one of the destinations with highest recall. In 2006, Kerala attracted 8.5 million tourists, an increase of 23.7% over the previous year, making the state one of the fastest-growing popular destinations in the world. In 2011, tourist inflow to Kerala crossed the 10-million mark.\n\nAyurvedic tourism has become very popular since the 1990s, and private agencies have played a notable role in tandem with the initiatives of the Tourism Department. Kerala is known for its ecotourism initiatives which include mountaineering, trekking and bird-watching programmes in the Western Ghats as the major activities. The state's tourism industry is a major contributor to the state's economy, growing at the rate of 13.3%. The revenue from tourism increased five-fold between 2001 and 2011 and crossed the \u20b9 190 billion mark in 2011. According to the Economic Times Kerala netted a record revenue of INR 365280.1 million from the tourism sector in 2018, clocking an increase of Rs 28743.3 million from the previous year. Over 16.7 million tourists visited Kerala in 2018 as against 15.76 million the previous year, recording an increase of 5.9%. The industry provides employment to approximately 1.2 million people.\n\nThe state's only drive-in beach, Muzhappilangad in Kannur, which stretches across five kilometres of sand, was chosen by the BBC as one of the top six drive-in beaches in the world in 2016.

From January 2021 until May 2022, Lada was integrated with then sister brand Dacia into Renault's Lada-Dacia business unit.\nThe first cars manufactured by AvtoVAZ were produced with technical assistance from Fiat and marketed under the Zhiguli designation. The Lada brand appeared in 1973, initially being overseas-focused before becoming AvtoVAZ's main brand for all markets in the 1990s. Renault took control of the brand in 2016. Technical assistance from the French company started in 2008, after it acquired a minority AvtoVAZ stake. Lada was re-acquired by the Russian government in  2022.\nOutside of the Eastern Bloc, Ladas were aimed squarely at the budget end of the market, where they were often as little as half the price of contemporary Western vehicles of the period. Lada vehicles are positioned as affordable and offering good value for money.\n\n\n== History ==", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1039, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a60e6ecb-c045-4d41-b9f0-86723aa65090": {"__data__": {"id_": "a60e6ecb-c045-4d41-b9f0-86723aa65090", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Ladakh.txt", "file_name": "Ladakh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 9309, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86c98de5-731f-4218-a38d-f31020cb1805", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Ladakh.txt", "file_name": "Ladakh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 9309, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "c41af3ce083f233dd24bb7bfa9115af74f4d54c5bd13b410d27e96cb7b07deb4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff778e7e-df34-42a8-96e7-73f9f72d72bf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Ladakh.txt", "file_name": "Ladakh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 9309, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "34bdc0be7e922b42e05dc2b56a6768e0dcdbc0b4addb82de92a6d2ba41bb2a70", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5b9f8503-479a-48a6-a071-191ba370828a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1141e5ac0a55cb4ee3783cf468d9e7fbf4c049f44ae027b85e1a8a87eece1455", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== History ==\n\n\n=== Soviet era ===\nAutomaker AvtoVAZ was formed from a collaboration between Fiat and the Soviet Vneshtorg (Department of Foreign Trade), and is based in the city of Tolyatti on the Volga River. Both sides discussed the proposal in Moscow, where Gianni Agnelli, company owner and nephew of the founder of Fiat, and Vittorio Valletta, the president of the company, had arrived from Italy. The first preliminary agreement was signed on 1 July 1965. On 4 May 1966, the Soviet minister of the automotive industry Alexander Tarasov and Vittorio Valletta put their signatures on a protocol on the scientific and technical cooperation between Fiat and the Soviet ministry. Eventually, a general agreement between the two sides was signed in Moscow on 15 August 1966. Fiat's subsidiary Comau supplied many of the automation systems in the plant.\nThe company began producing the VAZ-2101 in 1970, which was a more rugged version of the Fiat 124 sedan. The car was given heavier steel body panels and strengthened components, which improved reliability on bumpy roads and in the harsh winters of the Soviet Union.The first cars manufactured by AvtoVAZ with technical assistance from Fiat were marketed under the Zhiguli designation, allegedly chosen after it was suggested by designer, A. M. Cherny. When the cars began to be exported on foreign markets, the Zhiguli designation was found to be inappropriate, as it was hard to pronounce for non-Russian speakers, and it was said to resemble the word gigolo too closely. Lada become the brand for export markets. Due to the scarcity of auto-repair shops in the Soviet Union, Ladas were designed to be easily maintained by their owners. The rugged Lada was popular in Europe, Canada, and South America for customers looking for more affordable alternatives to local brands, and sales of the new cars were extremely successful, reaching as far as New Zealand. In the West, their construction was frequently described as cheap, and that inspired jokes at the car's expense; nonetheless, Lada \"gained a reputation as a maker of solid, unpretentious, and reliable cars for motorists who wanted to drive on a budget.\" The Lada brand appeared in 1973, and it has since become the main brand for AvtoVAZ vehicles.Since the original Fiat engine did not have any space for modernization, it was replaced with a new overhead camshaft engine. The car was equipped with rugged drum brakes on the rear, as the latter proved to be more reliable on poor roads. More reliable and up-to-date front and rear suspension with increased ground clearance, a modernized transmission, and recessed door handles were also fitted. The work on the new car was conducted by joint groups of NAMI and Fiat engineers, who worked together in Turin and Tolyatti. By the spring of 1970, AvtoVAZ had formed its own team of designers and engineers and worked independently.\nAfter having built several prototypes and experimental vehicles, AvtoVAZ designers launched the first car entirely of their design, the VAZ-2121 Niva, in 1977.\n\n\n=== Post-Soviet era ===\nThe 110-series sedan was introduced in 1995, two years after its original 1993 deadline. Development costs for the car were estimated at $2 billion. The 2111 station wagon followed in 1998 and the 2112 hatchback completed the range in 2001. A five-door version of the Niva, the VAZ-2131, was introduced in 1995.

A five-door version of the Niva, the VAZ-2131, was introduced in 1995.  However, by 1997, Lada was forced to withdraw from most Western European markets due to tightening emission and safety legislation.  Also, the rapid rise of Pacific Rim marques such as Hyundai, Kia, and Proton in the 1990s began to take over the budget sector of the market, in which Lada had survived since the 1970s, which also contributed to the marque's eventual demise in the West.\nThe VAZ-2120 Nadezhda, a minivan based on the Lada Niva, was introduced in 1998. In the second half of the 1990s, efforts were made to improve build quality, but in 1999,  nearly 50,000 instances occurred of cars being assembled with missing parts.The introduction of the new Kalina B-segment lineup to the market occurred in 2005. AutoVAZ built a new, modern plant for this model, hoping to sell some 200,000 cars annually. The Kalina had been originally designed in the early 1990s, and its launch was repeatedly delayed, exemplifying the company's difficulty in bringing products to market in time. In March 2007, Lada launched the Priora, a restyled and modernised 110-series model.\nIn March 2008, Renault purchased a minority 25% stake in AvtoVAZ in a US$1 billion deal, with Rostec retaining the remaining 75%. Sales of the Granta, a subcompact car developed in collaboration with Renault, started in December 2011. The Largus, another vehicle with Renault technology, was launched in the Russian market by the middle of July 2012. In August 2012, the XRAY concept car was launched at the Moscow International Automobile Salon. The XRAY was designed by then-chief designer Steve Mattin, formerly of Volvo and Mercedes-Benz. The second generation of the Lada Kalina, basically a facelifted first generation, was also revealed at the 2012 Moscow International Motor Show. The Kalina is also produced as the more powerful version named Lada Kalina Sport. Production of the Vesta, based on a new B\\C platform developed by AvtoVAZ in cooperation with the Renault-Nissan Alliance, started on 25 September 2015, at Lada Izhevsk manufacturing site. For the first time in Lada history, only a year had passed between the concept car and the start of production. In 2016, after various acquisitions, Renault became the parent company of AvtoVAZ and took control of Lada. The XRAY, based on a Dacia platform, was the first compact city crossover in the company's history. Sales started on 14 February 2016. In January 2021, after a company revamp, Renault said it would integrate Lada and sister brand Dacia into a Lada-Dacia business unit.In May 2022, due to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, Renault sold its controlling stake to \na state-owned entity, NAMI, for one symbolic Rouble. The deal, however, included various opportunities within a six year window for Renault to buy back its assets.

It was used by all its products irrespective of under which name they were marketed. This logo consisted of an upright, shield-like badge with a stylized Viking boat inside. In the mid-1990s, the company introduced a new logo, this time with a horizontal ellipse-like layout, still keeping the boat inside it. The logo design was maintained while being updated in 2002 and 2015.In 2004, AvtoVAZ officially ended the use of multiple designations for the Russian market, unifying from then on, all its products under the Lada brand.

It is an archipelago of 36 islands divided into three island subgroups: the Laccadive Islands in the middle with the Amindivi Islands in the north separated roughly by the 11th parallel north and the atoll of Minicoy to the south separated by the Nine Degree Channel along the 9th parallel north. The islands are sandwiched between the Arabian Sea to the west and the Laccadive Sea to the east with the islands located about 220\u2013440 km (140\u2013270 mi)  off the Malabar Coast of mainland India.\nThe islands occupy a total land area of approximately 32.62 km2 (12.59 sq mi) with a population of 64,473 as per the 2011 census in the 10 inhabited islands. The islands have a 132 km (82 mi) long coastline with a lagoon area of 4,200 km2 (1,600 sq mi), territorial waters of 20,000 km2 (7,700 sq mi) and an exclusive economic zone of 400,000 km2 (150,000 sq mi). The islands are the northernmost of the Lakshadweep\u2013Maldives\u2013Chagos group of islands, which are the tops of a vast undersea mountain range, the Chagos-Lakshadweep Ridge. The entire union territory is administered as a single district with Kavaratti as the capital.\nArchaeological evidence from Kalpeni indicate the existence of human settlement in the region from at least 1500 BCE with the earliest reference to the islands are from the Buddhist Jataka tales presumably from the third century BCE. There are references to the control of the islands by the Cheras, one of the three kingdoms of ancient Tamilakam in the Tamil Sangam literature Pati\u1e5f\u1e5fuppattu. The region was captured by the Pallavas in the 7th century CE before Islam is presumed to have been brought to the region with the arrival of Muslims. In 1n the 11th century CE, the region was part of the Chola kingdom, forming a part of the trade route which connected the Middle East with South Asia. It was briefly under the control of the Kingdom of Kannur before it came under the control of Portuguese in the late 15th century. After the expulsion of Portuguese in 1545, the region was ruled by the Arakkal kingdom, who were vassals to the Kolathiri Rajas of Kannur. The region came under the influence of Mysore kingdom in the late 18th century, which was annexed to the British empire, following the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War in 1799. The region became part of the Dominion of India following the Indian Independence in 1947 and became a union territory in 1956.\nThe name Lakshadweep means \"one lakh islands\" (Lak\u1e63adv\u012bpa; one hundred thousand islands) in Malayalam and Sanskrit, though the islands are part of an archipelago of few islands. English is designated as the official language while Jeseri, a dialect of Malayalam, is the widely spoken native language in the territory with Dhivehi being the most spoken in Minicoy Island.

Amindivi derives its name from the Amindivi people, who were earliest inhabitants of Amini Island.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nWhile it was presumed that Lakshadweep could have been part of the early human migration from Africa, genetic evidence points to the contrary with majority of human ancestry in the islands derived from South Asia. Archaeological evidence from Kalpeni indicate the existence of human settlement in the region from at least 1500 BCE. Jataka tales of Buddhism, dated to 300 BCE, mention the islands. Archeological evidence also support the spread of Buddhism to the islands during the time with Sanghmitra, daughter of Ashoka presumed to have visited the island in the third century BCE. There are references to the rule over the region by the Cheras in the Sangam period (300 BCE to 300CE), one of the three kingdoms of ancient Tamilakam in the Tamil Sangam literature Pati\u1e5f\u1e5fuppattu.The islands have long been known to sailors, first indicated by an anonymous reference in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea from the 1st century CE to the islands off the coast of Damirica as a source of a turtle shell. Ptolemy in 150 CE mentions 1378 islands located opposite to Taprobane with names of some of the islands given by Kanathara (Kavaratti), Argidion (Agatti), Ammine (Amini) and Monache (Minicoy). The islands were part of a trade route with the Roman empire, with archeological evidence from as early as 2nd century CE obtained from Kadamath and Androth. Travelers and historians such as Ammianus Marcellinus (4th century CE), Faxian (5th century CE) and Cosmas (6th century CE) mention the islands.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nLocal traditions attribute the first settlement on the islands to Cheraman Perumal, the last Chera king of Kerala, though no historical evidence exist apart from the ancient Hindu social stratification. According to popular tradition, Islam was brought to the islands by Ubaidullah in 661 CE, whose purported grave is located in Andrott.  Inscriptions from Vayalur indicate naval battles during the reign of Narasimhavarman II (680-720 CE), which resulted in the capture of the territory by the Pallavas of Kanchi in the late 7th century CE. Inscriptions indicate the capture of the region of Kavadi Dvepa, presumably Kavaratti, by the Kadambas in the 10th century CE. In the 11th century, the islands came under the rule of the Cholas. Chola inscriptions from Thanjavur, indicate that the region was captured by Rajendra Chola I in 1018-19 CE. In the late 11th century CE, it became part of a small Hindu kingdom before being passed on to the Kingdom of Kannur in early 12th century CE.

The islands are sandwiched between the Arabian Sea to the west and the Laccadive Sea to the east with the islands located about 220\u2013440 km (140\u2013270 mi) off the Malabar Coast of mainland India. The territory is divided into three island subgroups: the Laccadive Islands in the middle with the Amindivi Islands in the north separated roughly by the 11th parallel north and the atoll of Minicoy to the south separated by the Nine Degree Channel along the 9th parallel north. The islands occupy a total land area of approximately 32.62 km2 (12.59 sq mi) in 10 inhabited islands, 17 uninhabited islands attached islets, four newly formed islets and five submerged reefs. The islands have a 132 km (82 mi) long coastline with a lagoon area of 4,200 km2 (1,600 sq mi), territorial waters of 20,000 km2 (7,700 sq mi) and an exclusive economic zone of 400,000 km2 (150,000 sq mi).The islands are the northernmost of the Lakshadweep\u2013Maldives\u2013Chagos group of islands, which are the tops of a vast undersea mountain range, the Chagos-Lakshadweep Ridge. While there are no conclusive theories about the formation of the atolls, Charles Darwin proposed in 1842 that the subsidence of a volcanic island which resulted in the formation of a fringing reef with the continual subsidence allowing it to grow upwards. The islands are small with none more than 1 mile in breadth with most inhabited islands situated on the eastern side of the islands away from the low-lying lagoons on the western side. The soils are generally sandy, derived from the coral. According to a 2017 report, the Parali I island of Bangaram atoll has eroded and inundated completely with the other four islands in the atoll also showing various degrees of erosion: Parali II (80%), Thinnakara (14.4%), Parali III (11.4%) and Bangaram (9.9%).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe islands have a tropical monsoon climate, bordering on a tropical savanna climate.

There are five coir factories, five production demonstration centers and seven curling units run by the government which produce coir fiber, yarn and mattings.\nWith a vast lagoon area and an exclusive economic zone of 400,000 km2 (150,000 sq mi), fishery is a major industry. The estimated annual production is 21,016 tonnes of which 60% is tuna and related fishes with 60% of the total converted to dried products with 40% allocated for local consumption. Commercial fishing is concentrated around 11 islands with skipjack tuna and yellowfin tuna being the only commercial varieties fished. Fishing is done using mechanized fishing boats, traditional country crafts and country crafts fitted with motors. The government runs a tuna canning factory.The tourist industry in Lakshadweep traces to 1974, when the Bangaram atoll was opened for international tourism. According to India tourism statistics, 10,435 domestic tourists and 1,313 foreign tourists visited the islands in 2018. The government is promoting tourism as a means to increase the income of local population with the islands of Bangaram and Kadmat, promoted as tourist destinations. With marine fauna and coral reefs, various water sports activities such as scuba diving, wind surfing, snorkelling, surfing, kayaking, canoeing, water skiing, sportfishing, yachting and night sea voyages have been established to promote tourism. Tourists need a permission to visit the islands and foreign nationals are not permitted to visit certain islands. According to the current alcohol laws of India, alcoholic beverage consumption is not permitted in the islands except on Bangaram island.  The government has proposed programmes to improve infrastructure and promote tourism. The potential negative effects of tourism on the environment and ecosystem of the islands is a subject of debate.", "start_char_idx": 15146, "end_char_idx": 18136, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "100cc62d-59ab-41ba-815e-168d2a0fe2f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "100cc62d-59ab-41ba-815e-168d2a0fe2f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Lakshadweep.txt", "file_name": "Lakshadweep.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 21832, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e340f8b3-686a-42a4-8004-2b7a11156fe8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Lakshadweep.txt", "file_name": "Lakshadweep.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 21832, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "78f9b2bc100835135382ab658e6226e66f60c5b225aabe860c73b4d7ad1d87ee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "289114e4-dd91-4042-96a6-377d93eade11", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Lakshadweep.txt", "file_name": "Lakshadweep.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 21832, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "cc1fbbced78b3a707f730131a53c143b9c0241ee74b314728e66cad1fcdcdd52", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "79fcfd67-b5f2-44cd-a664-ae93867d984b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f00bebb1fddbb449007f48e2395a1822bdfd511df636bff9a1081c010aac1306", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Infrastructure ==\nThere is no single power grid connecting the islands and independent power houses caters to the power requirements of individual islands. Minicoy was the first island to be electrified in 1962 followed by Kavaratti in 1964 and others later, with Bitra being the last island to be electrified in 1982. Two diesel generators were established in 1962, generating 51.6 Kilo Watt. As of 2012, the installed capacity is 18.5 Mega Watt from 41 diesel generators and 12 solar photovoltaic systems.The world's first ever experimental low-temperature thermal desalination plant opened on Kavaratti in 2005, which uses the temperature difference between warm surface seawater and much colder seawater at 500 m (1,600 ft) depth to generate potable water as well as energy, was put in place to produce 100,000 litres/day of potable water from seawater. The technology was developed by the National Institute of Ocean Technology and government announced plans to build three further plants.Mobile communication service is provided by state-owned BSNL across all inhabited islands and Airtel in two islands of Kavratti and Agatti. In 2020, the government announced a project to install under-sea fiber optic cable for high-speed mobile and internet connectivity between Kochi and 11 islands of Lakshadweep. India Post operates nine post offices that provide mail service. There are four hospitals with 200 beds, four primary health centers, and 14 sub-health centers operated by the government.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe islands are served by Agatti Airport on Agatti island, the only airport in the territory. As the current 1.2 km (0.75 mi) long runway is capable of handling only smaller turboprop aircraft, the government has announced a plan in early 2024 to extend the runway to enable it to handle larger narrow body aircraft and expand the infrastructure to convert the airport into dual-use for civilian and military purposes. A new greenfield airport is also proposed to be constructed at Minicoy Island. Two helicopters are operated by Pawan Hans which serve for passenger transport and emergency medical evacuation across islands.As of 2019, there are 228 km (142 mi) of paved roads and no railway in the territory. As of 2024, additional roads have been planned including a peripheral road at Kavaratti and beach front roads at Kadamath and Agatti islands. As of 2023, seven ships operate passenger services between Kochi and the islands with seasonal boat/ferry service between islands. In 2024, the government unveiled a plan to develop three ports at Androth, Kalpeni and Kadamath islands as a part of the Sagar Mala project. There are fifteen lighthouses in the islands. The Minicoy Island Lighthouse was the first modern light house, established in 1885.Indian Navy operates INS Dweeprakshak, a naval based under the Southern Naval Command, commissioned in 2012. There are ten minor ports, one each on all inhabited islands.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe first public school was opened in Amini in 1904 with an elementary school opened in Kiltan in 1911 and Kadmat in 1925. As of 2023, there are 50 schools catering to 8,350 students.

Its capital is Bhopal, and the largest city is Indore, with Gwalior, Jabalpur, Ujjain, Dewas, Sagar, Satna, and Rewa being the other major cities. Madhya Pradesh is the second largest Indian state by area and the fifth largest state by population with over 72 million residents. It borders the states of Uttar Pradesh to the northeast, Chhattisgarh to the east, Maharashtra to the south, Gujarat to the west, and Rajasthan to the northwest.The area covered by the present-day Madhya Pradesh includes the area of the ancient Avanti Mahajanapada, whose capital Ujjain (also known as Avantika) arose as a major city during the second wave of Indian urbanisation in the sixth century BCE. Subsequently, the region was ruled by the major dynasties of India. The Maratha Empire dominated the majority of the 18th century. After the Anglo-Maratha Wars in the 19th century, the region was divided into several princely states under the British and incorporated into Central Provinces and Berar and the Central India Agency. Some years after India's independence, the Central Provinces and Berar was renamed as Madhya Pradesh with Nagpur as its capital: this state included the southern parts of the present-day Madhya Pradesh and northeastern portion of today's Maharashtra. In 1956, this state was reorganised and its parts were combined with the states of Madhya Bharat, Vindhya Pradesh and Bhopal to form the new Madhya Pradesh state, the Marathi-speaking Vidarbha region was removed and merged with the Bombay State. This state was the largest in India by area until 2000, when its southeastern Chhattisgarh region was designated a separate state.\nMadhya Pradesh's economy is the 10th-largest in India, with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of \u20b99.17 trillion (US$110 billion) and has the country's 26th highest per-capita income of \u20b9 109372. Madhya Pradesh ranks 23rd among Indian states in human development index. Rich in mineral resources, Madhya Pradesh has the largest reserves of diamond and copper in India. 25.14% of its area is under forest cover. Its tourism industry has seen considerable growth, with the state topping the National Tourism Awards in 2010\u201311. In recent years, the state's GDP growth has been above the national average. In 2019\u201320, state's GSDP was recorded at 9.07.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nMadhya Pradesh means \"the central province\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIsolated remains of Homo erectus found in Hathnora in the Narmada Valley indicates that Madhya Pradesh might have been inhabited in the Middle Pleistocene era. Painted pottery dated to the later mesolithic period has been found in the Bhimbetka rock shelters. Chalcolithic sites belonging to Kayatha culture (2100\u20131800 BCE) and Malwa culture (1700\u20131500 BCE) have been discovered in the western part of the state.

Ashoka the greatest of Mauryan rulers, conquered it, bringing the region under firmer control. After the decline of the Maurya empire, the region was contested among the Sakas, the Kushanas, the Satavahanas, and several local dynasties during the 1st to 3rd centuries CE. Heliodorus, the Greek Ambassador to the court of the Shunga King Bhagabhadra erected the Heliodorus pillar near Vidisha.\nUjjain emerged as the predominant commercial centre of western India from the first century CE, located on the trade routes between the Ganges plain and India's Arabian Sea ports. The Satavahana dynasty of the northern Deccan and the Saka dynasty of the Western Satraps fought for the control of Madhya Pradesh during the 1st to 3rd centuries CE.\nThe Satavahana King Gautamiputra Satakarni inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Saka rulers and conquered parts of Malwa and Gujarat in the 2nd century CE.Subsequently, the region was conquered by the Gupta empire in the 4th and 5th centuries, and their southern neighbours, the Vakataka's. The rock-cut temples at Bagh Caves in the Kukshi tehsil of the Dhar District show the presence of the Gupta dynasty in the region, supported by the testimony of a Badwani inscription dated to the year of 487 CE. The attacks of the Hephthalites or White Huns brought about the collapse of the Gupta empire, which broke up into smaller states. The King Yasodharman of Malwa defeated the Huns in 528, ending their expansion. Later, Harsha (c. 590\u2013647) ruled the northern parts of the state. Malwa was ruled by the south Indian Rashtrakuta Dynasty from the late 8th century to the 10th century. When the south Indian Emperor Govinda III of the Rashtrakuta dynasty annexed Malwa, he set up the family of one of his subordinates there, who took the name of Paramara.The Medieval period saw the rise of the Rajput clans, including the Paramaras of Malwa and the Chandelas of Bundelkhand along with the Lodhis. The Chandellas built the majestic Hindu-Jain temples at Khajuraho, which represent the culmination of Hindu temple architecture in Central India. The Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty also held sway in northern and western Madhya Pradesh at this time. It also left some monuments of architectural value in Gwalior. Southern parts of Madhya Pradesh like Malwa were several times invaded by the south Indian Western Chalukya Empire which imposed its rule on the Paramara kingdom of Malwa. The Paramara King Bhoja (c. 1010\u20131060) was claimed to be a renowned polymath. The small Gond kingdoms emerged in the Gondwana and Mahakoshal regions of the state.

Hemu, who had earlier served as the General of the Islamic Suri dynasty, operated from the Gwalior Fort during 1553\u201356 and became the ruler of Delhi as a Vikramaditya king winning 22 battles continuously from Bengal to Gujrat and defeating Akbar's forces in the Battle of Delhi on 7 October 1556. However, he chose Delhi as his capital after his formal Coronation and left Gwalior. After Hemu's defeat by Akbar at the Second Battle of Panipat in 1556, most of Madhya Pradesh came under the Mughal rule. Gondwana and Mahakoshal remained under the control of Gond kings, who acknowledged Mughal suzerainty but enjoyed virtual autonomy.\nThe Mughal control weakened considerably after the death of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707. Between 1720 and 1760, the Marathas conquered most of Madhya Pradesh, resulting in the establishment of semi-autonomous states under the nominal control of the Peshwa of Pune: the Holkars of Indore ruled much of Malwa, Pawars ruled Dewas and Dhar, the Bhonsles of Nagpur dominated Mahakoshal-Gondwana area, while the Scindias of Gwalior controlled the northern parts of the state. The most notable Maratha rulers of the region were Mahadji Shinde, Ahilyabai Holkar and Yashwantrao Holkar. Besides these, there were several other small states, including Bhopal, Orchha, and Rewa. The Bhopal state, which paid tribute to both the Marathas and the Nizam of Hyderabad, was founded by Dost Mohammed Khan, a former General in the Mughal army.\nAfter the Third Anglo-Maratha War, the British conquered the entire region. All the sovereign states in the region became princely states of British India, governed by the Central India Agency. The Mahakoshal region became a British province: the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories. In 1861, the British merged the Nagpur Province with the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories to form the Central Provinces.\nDuring the 1857 uprising, rebellions happened in the northern parts of the state, led by leaders like Tatya Tope, Rani Avantibai Lodhi. However, these were crushed by the British and the princes loyal to them. The state witnessed a number of anti-British activities and protests during the Indian independence movement. Several notable leaders such as Chandra Shekhar Azad, B. R. Ambedkar, Shankar Dayal Sharma, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Arjun Singh were born in what is now Madhya Pradesh.", "start_char_idx": 5845, "end_char_idx": 8836, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54f20f77-c280-49e6-a8eb-6b607606ddcc": {"__data__": {"id_": "54f20f77-c280-49e6-a8eb-6b607606ddcc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Madhya_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Madhya_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38418, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d74e35f6-83d9-45df-9000-c673ad2e66aa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Madhya_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Madhya_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38418, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "5f4acd0ef3926debc7ba20e40f96cee62811a6d2db39025ebaf9a5301bdb0927", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "450ddc27-16c6-458b-8316-6ac3b827e3a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Madhya_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Madhya_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38418, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "75c56cb662b363d9cf49b9231091927a24e64f44433240cc31fddfc77b9c22a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "56ad2ec5-2935-4381-8f00-08132e6d9465", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ad747e1549fac100bc6b39c848b0f5dc33fa6865f44aadf84712ecc4ad893a46", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The state witnessed a number of anti-British activities and protests during the Indian independence movement.

During summer (March\u2013June), the temperature in the entire state ranges above 34.6 it has increased as it is all-time high in Madhya Pradesh. In general, the eastern parts of Madhya Pradesh are hotter than the western parts. The regions like Gwalior, Morena and Datia record temperatures of over 42 \u00b0C in May. The humidity is relatively very low and the region usually experiences frequent mild dust storms. The southwest Monsoon usually breaks out in mid-June and the entire state receives a major share of its rainfall between June and September. The south and south-east regions tend to experience a higher rainfall whereas the parts of the north-west receive less. Mandla, Balaghat, Sidhi, Jabalpur, and other extreme eastern parts receive more than 150 cm of rainfall. The districts of western Madhya Pradesh receive less than 80 cm of rainfall.The winter season starts in November. The temperature remains low in the northern parts of the state in comparison to the southern parts. The daily maximum temperature in most of the northern part of January remains between 15 and 18 \u00b0C. The climate is generally dry and pleasant with a clear sky. The average rainfall is about 1,194 mm (47.0 in). The southeastern districts have the heaviest rainfall, some places receiving as much as 2,150 mm (84.6 in), while the western and northwestern districts receive 1,000 mm (39.4 in) or less.\n\n\n=== Ecology ===\nAccording to the 2011 figures, the recorded forest area of the state is 94,689 km2 (36,560 sq mi) constituting 30.7% of the geographical area of the state.

Per capita forest area is 2,400 m2 (0.59 acres) as against the national average of 700 m2 (0.17 acres). The forest cover is less dense in the northern and western parts of the state, which contain the major urban centres. Variability in climatic and edaphic conditions brings about significant difference in the forest types of the state.

It flows westward through a rift valley, with the Vindhya ranges sprawling along its northern bank and the Satpura range of mountains along the southern. Its tributaries include the Banjar, the Tawa, the Machna, the Shakkar, the Denwa and the Sonbhadra rivers. The Tapti River runs parallel to Narmada, and also flows through a rift valley. The Narmada\u2013Tapti systems carry an enormous volume of water and provide drainage for almost a quarter of the land area of Madhya Pradesh. The Narmada river is considered very sacred and is worshipped throughout the region. It is the main source of water and acts as a lifeline to the state.\nThe Vindhyas form the southern boundary of the Ganges basin, with the western part of the Ganges basin draining into the Yamuna and the eastern part directly into the Ganges itself. All the rivers, which drain into the Ganges, flow from south to north, with the Chambal, Shipra, Kali Sindh, Parbati, Kuno, Sind, Betwa, Dhasan and Ken rivers being the main tributaries of the Yamuna. Shipra River is one of the most sacred rivers of Hinduism. It is the site of the Simhastha Kumbh Mela, which is held every 12 years. Shipra is stretched across Indore, Ujjain and Dewas. The land drained by these rivers is agriculturally rich, with the natural vegetation largely consisting of grass and dry deciduous forest types, largely thorny. The eastern part of the Ganges basin consists of the Son, the Tons and the Rihand Rivers. Son, which arises in the Maikal hills around Amarkantak, is the largest tributary that goes into the Ganges on the south bank and that does not arise from the Himalayas. Son and its tributaries contribute the bulk of the monsoon flow into the Ganges, because the north bank tributaries are all snow fed. The forests in their basins are much richer than the thorn forests of the northwestern part of Madhya Pradesh.\nAfter the formation of Chhattisgarh State, the major portion of Mahanadi basin now lies in Chhattisgarh. Presently, only 154 km2 basin area of Hasdeo River in Anuppur District lies in Madhya Pradesh.\nThe Satpuras, in the Gawilgarh and Mahadeo Hills, also contain a watershed, which is south facing. The Wainganga, the Wardha, the Pench, the Kanhan rivers, discharge an enormous volume of water into the Godavari river system. The Godavari basin consists of sub-tropical, semi-moist forests, mainly in the valley of the Indrawati.

In urban areas Standard Hindi is the main language, while Urdu is spoken by Muslims. In rural areas, however, most speak varieties counted as dialects of Hindi in the census, although most are quite distinct. In the west are Malvi and Nimadi in the Malwa and Nimar regions, which are more closely related to the Rajasthani languages. In Bundelkhand in the north and Baghelkhand in the east are spoken Bundeli and Bagheli which are eastern varieties of the Hindi languages, similar to Awadhi or Chhattisgarhi. In the southeast is spoken Chhattisgarhi and Powari is the language of the far south, both Eastern Hindi languages. Most speakers of these languages consider them to be dialects of Hindi and so report their language as 'Hindi' on the census.Marathi is another significant language. Due to Maratha rule over much of what is now Madhya Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh is home to the largest number of Marathis outside Maharashtra. Although large numbers of Marathis can be found in urban centres like Indore, the highest concentrations are in the southern areas of the state adjoining Maharashtra. Marathi is the most-spoken language in Burhanpur district, while it is a major minority language in the southern parts of Mahakoshal especially Betul, Chhindwara and Balaghat districts.There are several languages spoken by the Adivasis. The various Bhil languages are Indo-Aryan languages spoken by 50 lakh Bhils of western Madhya Pradesh. Although many, especially in the eastern parts of their range, have adopted the regional languages as mother tongue, the languages are still strong in the far-western hills especially Barwani, Jhabua and Alirajpur districts where they are in the majority. Bhili, the Bareli languages and Bhilali are the major varieties spoken in the state.\nGondi is the second-largest Adivasi language, spoken by 11 lakh Gonds in the state. A Dravidian language related to Telugu, it is mainly spoken in the southern Satpura highlands of Mahakoshal, where it is spoken with the regional languages. Some in the remoter valleys of the Satpuras speak a poorly-described Dravidian dialect called Bharia. Smaller minorities of Gondi speakers can be found in Khandwa and Dewas districts in the west as well as Anuppur, Sidhi and Singrauli districts in the east. Elsewhere in the state, the Gonds have almost totally abandoned their original language.\nKorku, a Munda language, has over 400,000 speakers in the central highlands of the state. In the far-southeast of Burhanpur can be found some speakers of the language isolate Nihali who live among the Korku. All speakers of tribal languages face significant pressure to switch to the dominant regional languages while their own tongues are considered 'backward' and 'rural'.The following languages are taught in schools in Madhya Pradesh under the Three Language Formula:First language: Any Scheduled Language\nSecond language: Hindi, Urdu or English\nThird language: Another Scheduled Language, Arabic, Persian, French, Russian", "start_char_idx": 19072, "end_char_idx": 22222, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3579772c-0a22-4b30-9817-74c2d8d90e8e": {"__data__": {"id_": "3579772c-0a22-4b30-9817-74c2d8d90e8e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Madhya_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Madhya_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38418, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d74e35f6-83d9-45df-9000-c673ad2e66aa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Madhya_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Madhya_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38418, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "5f4acd0ef3926debc7ba20e40f96cee62811a6d2db39025ebaf9a5301bdb0927", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "84282967-6903-4f3d-ba66-349f0119f1b0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Madhya_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Madhya_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38418, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "34264ab4e9d61478eea8474f6a1c29393cc6d2063d3b7a7e352870bd85d4de98", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8e6b1978-3eaf-4363-9386-f54bc5ca6673", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "54a3b0840b26f937ca2475e75374a6cf3e0f1ac4f3f1f75866176c4418ba17d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Religion ===\nHinduism is the main religion and is followed by 90.9% of the population.\nAccording to the census of 2011, 90.9% of residents followed Hinduism, while minorities are Muslim (6.6%), Jain (0.8%), Buddhists (0.3%), Christians (0.3%), and Sikhs (0.2%).

On 1 May 1960, the State of Bombay was bifurcated into the State of Maharasthra and State of Gujarat after a long struggle for special state for Marathi language speaking people through Samyukta Maharashtra Movement (transl.\u2009United Maharashtra movement).\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe modern Marathi language evolved from the Maharashtri Prakrit, and the word Marhatta (later used for the Marathas) is found in the Jain Maharashtrian literature. The term Maharashtra (Marathi: \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930) along with Maharashtrian, Marathi, and Maratha may have derived from the same root. However, their exact etymology is uncertain.The most widely accepted theory among the linguistic scholars is that the words Maratha and Maharashtra ultimately derived from a combination of Mah\u0101 (Marathi: \u092e\u0939\u093e) and R\u0101shtrik\u0101 (Marathi: \u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0915\u093e), the name of a tribe or dynasty of chiefs ruling in the Deccan region. An alternate theory states that the term is derived from mah\u0101 (\"great\") and ratha/rathi (\"chariot\"/\"charioteer\"), which refers to a skilful northern fighting force that migrated southward into the area.In the Harivamsa, the Yadava kingdom called Anaratta is described as mostly inhabited by the Abhiras (Abhira-praya-manusyam). The Anartta country and its inhabitants were called Surastra and the Saurastras, probably after the Rattas (Rastras) akin to the Rastrikas of Asoka's rock Edicts, now known as Maharastra and the Marattas.An alternative theory states that the term derives from the word mah\u0101 (\"great\") and r\u0101shtra (\"nation/dominion\"). However, this theory is somewhat controversial among modern scholars who believe it to be the Sanskritised interpretation of later writers.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNumerous Late Harappan or Chalcolithic sites belonging to the Jorwe culture (c.\u20091300\u2013700 BCE) have been discovered throughout the state. The largest settlement discovered of the culture is at Daimabad, which had a mud fortification during this period, as well as an elliptical temple with fire pits. In the Late Harappan period there was a large migration of people from Gujarat to northern Maharashtra.Maharashtra was ruled by Maurya Empire in the fourth and third centuries BCE. Around 230 BCE, Maharashtra came under the rule of the Satavahana dynasty which ruled it for the next 400 years. The rule of Satavahana dynasty was followed by that of Western Satraps, Gupta Empire, Gurjara-Pratihara, Vakataka, Kadambas, Chalukya Empire, Rashtrakuta Dynasty, and Western Chalukya and the Yadava Dynasty. The Buddhist Ajanta Caves in present-day Aurangabad display influences from the Satavahana and Vakataka styles. The caves were possibly excavated during this period.The Chalukya dynasty ruled the region from the sixth to the eighth centuries CE, and the two prominent rulers were Pulakeshin II, who defeated the north Indian Emperor Harsha, and Vikramaditya II, who defeated the Arab invaders in the eighth century.

The Arab traveller Sulaiman al Mahri described the ruler of the Rashtrakuta dynasty Amoghavarsha as \"one of the four great kings of the world\". Shilahara dynasty began as vassals of the Rashtrakuta dynasty which ruled the Deccan plateau between the eighth and tenth centuries. From the early 11th century to the 12th century, the Deccan Plateau, which includes a significant part of Maharashtra, was dominated by the Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola dynasty. Several battles were fought between the Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola dynasty in the Deccan Plateau during the reigns of Raja Raja Chola I, Rajendra Chola I, Jayasimha II, Someshvara I, and Vikramaditya VI.In the early 14th century, the Yadava dynasty, which ruled most of present-day Maharashtra, was overthrown by the Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khalji. Later, Muhammad bin Tughluq conquered parts of the Deccan, and temporarily shifted his capital from Delhi to Daulatabad in Maharashtra. After the collapse of the Tughluqs in 1347, the local Bahmani Sultanate of Gulbarga took over, governing the region for the next 150 years. After the break-up of the Bahamani sultanate in 1518, Maharashtra split into five Deccan Sultanates: Nizamshah of Ahmednagar, Adilshah of Bijapur, Qutubshah of Golkonda, Bidarshah of Bidar and Imadshah of Elichpur. These kingdoms often fought with each other. United, they decisively defeated the Vijayanagara Empire of the south in 1565. The present area of Mumbai was ruled by the Sultanate of Gujarat before its capture by Portugal in 1535 and the Faruqi dynasty ruled the Khandesh region between 1382 and 1601 before finally getting annexed in the Mughal Empire. Malik Ambar, the regent of the Nizamshahi dynasty of Ahmednagar from 1607 to 1626, increased the strength and power of Murtaza Nizam Shah II and raised a large army.Ambar is said to have introduced the concept of guerrilla warfare in the Deccan region. Malik Ambar assisted Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in Delhi against his stepmother, Nur Jahan, who wanted to enthrone her son-in-law. Both Shivaji's grandfather, Maloji and father Shahaji served under Ambar.\nIn the early 17th century, Shahaji Bhosale, an ambitious local general who had served the Ahmadnagar Sultanate, the Mughals and Adil Shah of Bijapur at different periods throughout his career, attempted to establish his independent rule. This attempt was unsuccessful, but his son Shivaji succeeded in establishing the Maratha Empire. Shortly after Shivaji's death in 1680, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb launched a campaign to conquer Maratha territories as well as the Adilshahi and Govalkonda kingdoms. This campaign, better known as Mughal\u2013Maratha Wars, was a strategic defeat for Mughals.

Aurangzeb failed to fully conquer Maratha territories, and this campaign had a ruinous effect on Mughal Treasury and Army. Shortly after Aurangzeb's death in 1707, Marathas under Peshwa Bajirao I and the generals that he had promoted such as Ranoji Shinde and Malharrao Holkar started conquering Mughal Territories in the north and western India, and by 1750s they or their successors had confined the Mughals to city of Delhi. In the east the Bhonsale family of Nagpur expanded Maratha control all the way to Bengal. At its peak, the Maratha empire covered much of the subcontinent, encompassing a territory of over 2.8 million km2. The Marathas are credited to a large extent for ending the Mughal rule in India.After their defeat at the hand of Ahmad Shah Abdali's Afghan forces in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, the Maratha suffered a setback. However, they soon reclaimed the lost territories and ruled central and north India including Delhi until the end of the eighteenth century. The Marathas also developed a potent Navy circa in the 1660s, which at its peak under the command of Kanhoji Angre, dominated the territorial waters of the western coast of India from Mumbai to Savantwadi. It resisted the British, Portuguese, Dutch, and Siddi naval ships and kept a check on their naval ambitions. Charles Metcalfe, British Civil servant and later Acting Governor-General, said in 1806 \nIndia contains no more than two great powers, British and Maratha, and every other state acknowledges the influence of one or the other. Every inch that we recede will be occupied by them.\nThe British East India Company slowly expanded areas under its rule during the 18th century. The Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817\u20131818) led to the end of the Maratha Empire and the East India Company took over the empire. The Maratha Navy dominated till around the 1730s, was in a state of decline by the 1770s and ceased to exist by 1818.\nThe British governed western Maharashtra as part of the Bombay Presidency, which spanned an area from Karachi in Pakistan to northern Deccan. A number of the Maratha states persisted as princely states, retaining autonomy in return for acknowledging British suzerainty. The largest princely states in the territory were Nagpur, Satara and Kolhapur State; Satara was annexed to the Bombay Presidency in 1848, and Nagpur was annexed in 1853 to become Nagpur Province, later part of the Central Provinces. Berar, which had been part of the Nizam of Hyderabad's kingdom, was occupied by the British in 1853 and annexed to the Central Provinces in 1903. However, a large region called Marathwada remained part of the Nizam's Hyderabad State throughout the British period. The British ruled Maharashtra region from 1818 to 1947 and influenced every aspect of life for the people of the region. They brought several changes to the legal system, built modern means of transport including roads and Railways, took various steps to provide mass education, including that for previously marginalised classes and women, established universities based on western system and imparting education in science, technology, and western medicine, standardised the Marathi language, and introduced mass media by utilising modern printing technologies.", "start_char_idx": 8920, "end_char_idx": 12263, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9928ac57-5c74-4728-8c21-000cb5e0f714": {"__data__": {"id_": "9928ac57-5c74-4728-8c21-000cb5e0f714", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Maharashtra.txt", "file_name": "Maharashtra.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 80638, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "80eef64e-d2ee-46cb-99e8-194a15d20fea", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Maharashtra.txt", "file_name": "Maharashtra.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 80638, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "23ab658ae1dc2f53285bf9a4ea59d3b772dab236298add907da9011bf79ed79a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8dd7e786-db87-4e6b-a929-f8ba95daf0e3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Maharashtra.txt", "file_name": "Maharashtra.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 80638, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "aa6c740321cadff48a0e37f5562b58f260bd75181452d3b200b8288677e4ff49", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d6ba856-2c3c-4120-89b5-5e441508c537", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f0182d3855bf817a2dbf8d238f543ea09cb58dc1fa4b2ad27d9f97da97f19955", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "They brought several changes to the legal system, built modern means of transport including roads and Railways, took various steps to provide mass education, including that for previously marginalised classes and women, established universities based on western system and imparting education in science, technology, and western medicine, standardised the Marathi language, and introduced mass media by utilising modern printing technologies. The 1857 war of independence had many Marathi leaders, though the battles mainly took place in northern India. The modern struggle for independence started taking shape in the late 1800s with leaders such as Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Pherozeshah Mehta and Dadabhai Naoroji evaluating the company rule and its consequences. Jyotirao Phule was the pioneer of social reform in the Maharashtra region in the second half of the 19th century. His social work was continued by Shahu, Raja of Kolhapur and later by B. R. Ambedkar. After the partial autonomy given to the states by the Government of India Act 1935, B. G. Kher became the first Chief Minister of the Congress party-led Government of tri-lingual Bombay Presidency. The ultimatum to the British during the Quit India Movement was given in Mumbai and culminated in the transfer of power and independence in 1947.\nAfter Indian independence, princely states and Jagirs of the Deccan States Agency were merged into Bombay State, which was created from the former Bombay Presidency in 1950. In 1956, the States Reorganisation Act reorganised the Indian states along linguistic lines, and Bombay Presidency State was enlarged by the addition of the predominantly Marathi-speaking regions of Marathwada (Aurangabad Division) from erstwhile Hyderabad state and Vidarbha region from the Central Provinces and Berar. The southernmost part of Bombay State was ceded to Mysore. In the 1950s, Marathi people strongly protested against bilingual Bombay state under the banner of Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti. The notable leaders of the samiti included Keshavrao Jedhe, S.M. Joshi, Shripad Amrit Dange, Pralhad Keshav Atre and Gopalrao Khedkar. The key demand of the samiti called for a Marathi speaking state with Mumbai as its capital. In the Gujarati speaking areas of the state, a similar Mahagujarat Movement demanded a separate Gujarat state comprising majority Gujarati areas. After many years of protests, which saw 106 deaths amongst the protestors, and electoral success of the samiti in 1957 elections, the central government led by Prime minister Nehru split Bombay State into two new states of Maharashtra and Gujarat on 1 May 1960.The state continues to have a dispute with Karnataka regarding the region of Belgaum and Karwar. The Government of Maharashtra was unhappy with the border demarcation of 1957 and filed a petition to the Ministry of Home affairs of India.

It occupies the western and central part of the country and has a coastline stretching 840 kilometres along the Arabian Sea. The dominant physical feature of the state is its plateau character, which is separated from the Konkan coastline by the mountain range of the Western Ghats, which runs parallel to the coast from north to south. The Western Ghats, also known as the Sahyadri Range, has an average elevation of 1,200 metres (4,000 ft); its slopes gently descending towards the east and southeast. The Western Ghats (or the Sahyadri Mountain range) provide a physical barrier to the state on the west, while the Satpura Hills along the north and Bhamragad-Chiroli-Gaikhuri ranges on the east serve as its natural borders. This state's expansion from North to South is 720 km and East to West is 800 km. To the west of these hills lie the Konkan coastal plains, 50\u201380 kilometres in width. To the east of the Ghats lies the flat Deccan Plateau. The main rivers of the state are the Krishna, and its tributary, Bhima, the Godavari, and its main tributaries, Manjara, and Wardha-Wainganga and the Tapi, and its tributary Purna. Maharashtra is divided into five geographic regions. Konkan is the western coastal region, between the Western Ghats and the sea. Khandesh is the north region lying in the valley of the Tapti, Purna river. Nashik, Malegaon Jalgaon, Dhule and Bhusawal are the major cities of this region. Desh is in the centre of the state. Marathwada, which was a part of the princely state of Hyderabad until 1956, is located in the southeastern part of the state. Aurangabad and Nanded are the main cities of the region. Vidarbha is the easternmost region of the state, formerly part of the Central Provinces and Berar.The state has limited area under irrigation, low natural fertility of soils, and large areas prone to recurrent drought. Due to this the agricultural productivity of Maharashtra is generally low as compared to the national averages of various crops. Maharashtra has been divided in to nine agro-climatic zones on the basis of annual rainfall soil types, vegetation and cropping pattern.", "start_char_idx": 14735, "end_char_idx": 17414, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23a5f105-e10d-4bba-a228-71ec00a817f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "23a5f105-e10d-4bba-a228-71ec00a817f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Maharashtra.txt", "file_name": "Maharashtra.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 80638, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "80eef64e-d2ee-46cb-99e8-194a15d20fea", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Maharashtra.txt", "file_name": "Maharashtra.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 80638, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "23ab658ae1dc2f53285bf9a4ea59d3b772dab236298add907da9011bf79ed79a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3d6ba856-2c3c-4120-89b5-5e441508c537", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Maharashtra.txt", "file_name": "Maharashtra.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 80638, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "d0c657c310c6db1892eee33424ef2ff8bf0952118df2e758f23a0dc76eaec334", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9049d7ed-d2cc-4f97-b7eb-26cfac911c8f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "04eb828278ee07b12bebb73d0534ea439ec79df97b261c486fdc082078d1bb62", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Climate ===\nMaharashtra experiences a tropical wet and dry climate with hot, rainy, and cold weather seasons. Some areas more inland experience a hot semi arid climate, due to a rain shadow effect caused by the Western Ghats.  The month of March marks the beginning of the summer and the temperature rises steadily until June. In the central plains, summer temperatures rise to between 40 \u00b0C or 104.0 \u00b0F and 45 \u00b0C or 113.0 \u00b0F. May is usually the warmest and January the coldest month of the year. The winter season lasts until February with lower temperatures occurring in December and January. On the Deccan plateau that lies on eastern side of the Sahyadri mountains, the climate is drier, however, dew and hail often occur, depending on seasonal weather.The rainfall patterns in the state vary by the topography of different regions. The state can be divided into four meteorological regions, namely coastal Konkan, Western Maharashtra, Marathwada, and Vidarbha. The southwest monsoon usually arrives in the last week of June and lasts till mid-September. Pre-monsoon showers begin towards the middle of June and post-monsoon rains occasionally occur in October. The highest average monthly rainfall is during July and August. In the winter season, there may be a little rainfall associated with western winds over the region. The Konkan coastal area, west of the Sahyadri Mountains receives very heavy monsoon rains with an annual average of more than 3,000 mm. However, just 150 km to the east, in the rain shadow of the mountain range, only 500\u2013700 mm/year will fall, and long dry spells leading to drought are a common occurrence. Maharashtra has many of the 99 Indian districts identified by the Indian Central water commission as prone to drought. The average annual rainfall in the state is 1,181 mm and 75 per cent of it is received during the southwest monsoon from June\u2013to September. However, under the influence of the Bay of Bengal, eastern Vidarbha receives good rainfall in July, August, and September. Thane, Raigad, Ratnagiri, and Sindhudurg districts receive heavy rains of an average of 2,000 to 2,500 mm or 80 to 100 in and the hill stations of Matheran and Mahabaleshwar over 5,000 mm or 200 in. Contrariwise, the rain shadow districts of Nashik, Pune, Ahmednagar, Dhule, Jalgaon, Satara, Sangli, Solapur, and parts of Kolhapur receive less than 1,000 mm or 40 in annually. In winter, a cool dry spell occurs, with clear skies, gentle air breeze, and pleasant weather that prevails from October to February, although the eastern Vidarbha region receives rainfall from the north-east monsoon.\n\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\nThe state has three crucial biogeographic zones, namely Western Ghats, Deccan Plateau, and the West coast. The Ghats nurture endemic species, Deccan Plateau provides for vast mountain ranges and grasslands while the coast is home to littoral and swamp forests. Flora of Maharashtra is heterogeneous in composition. In 2012 the recorded thick forest area in the state was 61,939 km2 (23,915 sq mi) which was about 20.13 per cent of the state's geographical area.

Contributing to 9.28 per cent of India's population, males and females are 58,243,056 and 54,131,277, respectively. The total population growth in 2011 was 15.99 per cent while in the previous decade it was 22.57 per cent. Since independence, the decadal growth rate of population has remained higher (except in the year 1971) than the national average. However, in the year 2011, it was found to be lower than the national average. The 2011 census for the state found 55 per cent of the population to be rural with 45 per cent being urban-based. Although, India hasn't conducted a caste-wise census since Independence, based on the British era census of 1931, it is estimated that the Maratha and the Maratha-kunbi numerically form the largest caste cluster with around 32 per cent of the population. Maharashtra has a large Other Backward Class population constituting 41 per cent of the population. The scheduled tribes include Adivasis such as Thakar, Warli, Konkana and Halba.

At present, it has been dominated by four political parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Nationalist Congress Party, the Indian National Congress and the Shivsena.The politics of the state in the last five years has seen long term alliances breaking up like that of undivided Shivsena and BJP, new ones being formed between Congress, NCP, and the Shivsena, regional parties like the Shivsena and NCP splitting up, and majority of their legislators joining a new alliance government with the BJP.\nJust like in other states in India, dynastic politics is fairly common also among political parties in Maharashtra.", "start_char_idx": 31438, "end_char_idx": 35499, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d5c4e2b-919c-4af1-9bf1-4d070edee03d": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d5c4e2b-919c-4af1-9bf1-4d070edee03d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Maharashtra.txt", "file_name": "Maharashtra.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 80638, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "80eef64e-d2ee-46cb-99e8-194a15d20fea", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Maharashtra.txt", "file_name": "Maharashtra.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 80638, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "23ab658ae1dc2f53285bf9a4ea59d3b772dab236298add907da9011bf79ed79a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7105285e-d97e-4be4-9f22-3d35b19b9045", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Maharashtra.txt", "file_name": "Maharashtra.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 80638, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "2e716207033f5e6600f9abd6741c80b947149f9a0df4bc0e814947a345028c9d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9e433724-b74f-4f60-a7f4-383562dc783c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b3a04c58b89967d72c795cbd896233d765fe184b0554a7d4857aea9233bff756", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Just like in other states in India, dynastic politics is fairly common also among political parties in Maharashtra. The dynastic phenomenon is seen from the national level down to the district level and even village level. The three-tier structure of Panchayati Raj created in the state in the 1960s also helped to create and consolidate this phenomenon in rural areas. Apart from controlling the government, political families also control cooperative institutions, mainly cooperative sugar factories and district cooperative banks in the state. The Bharatiya Janata Party also features several senior leaders who are dynasts. In Maharashtra, the NCP has a particularly high level of dynasticism.In the early years, the politics of Maharashtra was dominated by Congress party figures such as Yashwantrao Chavan, Vasantdada Patil, Vasantrao Naik, and Shankarrao Chavan. Sharad Pawar, who started his political career in the Congress party, has been a towering personality in state and national politics for over forty years. During his career, he has split the Congress twice with significant consequences for the state politics. The Congress party enjoyed a near unchallenged dominance of the political landscape until 1995 when the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured an overwhelming majority in the state to form a coalition government. After his second parting from the Congress party in 1999, Sharad Pawar founded the NCP but then formed a coalition with the Congress to keep out the BJP-Shiv Sena combine out of the Maharashtra state government for fifteen years until September 2014. Prithviraj Chavan of the Congress party was the last Chief Minister of Maharashtra under the Congress-NCP alliance. For the 2014 assembly polls, the two alliances between NCP and Congress and that between BJP and Shiv Sena respectively broke down over seat allocations. In the election, the largest number of seats went to the Bharatiya Janata Party, with 122 seats. The BJP initially formed a minority government under Devendra Fadnavis. The Shiv Sena entered the Government after two months and provided a comfortable majority for the alliance in the Maharashtra Vidhansabha for the duration of the assembly. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance secured 41 seats out of 48 from the state. Later in 2019, the BJP and Shiv Sena alliance fought the assembly elections together but the alliance broke down after the election over the post of the chief minister. Uddhav Thackeray of Shiv Sena then formed an alternative governing coalition under his leadership with his erstwhile opponents from NCP, INC, and several independent members of the legislative assembly. Thackeray served as the 19th Chief minister of Maharashtra of the Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition until June 2022.In late June 2022, Eknath Shinde, a senior Shiv Sena leader, and the majority of MLAs from Shiv Sena joined hands with the BJP. Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari called for a trust vote, an action that would later on be described as a \"sad spectacle\" by Supreme Court of India, and draw criticism from Political Observers. Uddhav Thackeray resigned from the post as chief minister well as a MLC member ahead of no-confidence motion on 29 June 2022. Shinde subsequently formed a new coalition with the BJP, and was sworn in as the Chief Minister on 30 June 2022.

Maharashtra was a pioneer in the development of Agricultural Cooperative Societies after independence. It was an integral part of the then Governing Congress party's vision of 'rural development with local initiative'. A 'special' status was accorded to the sugar cooperatives and the government assumed the role of a mentor by acting as a stakeholder, guarantor, and regulator, Apart from sugar, cooperatives play a crucial role in dairy, cotton, and fertiliser industries.\nThe banking sector comprises scheduled and non-scheduled banks. Scheduled banks are of two types, commercial and cooperative. Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) in India are classified into five types: State Bank of India and its associates, nationalised banks, private sector banks, Regional Rural Banks, and others (foreign banks).

In 2011, the total length of surface road in Maharashtra was 267,452 km; national highways accounted for 4,176 km, and state highways 3,700 km. The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) provides economical and reliable passenger road transport service in the public sector. These buses, popularly called ST (State Transport), are the preferred mode of transport for much of the populace. Hired forms of transport include metered taxis and auto-rickshaws, which often ply specific routes in cities. Other district roads and village roads provide villages, accessibility to meet their social needs as well as the means to transport agricultural produce from villages to nearby markets. Major district roads provide a secondary function of linking between main roads and rural roads. Approximately 98 per cent of villages are connected either via the highways or modern roads in Maharashtra. Average speed on state highways varies between 50 and 60 km/h (31\u201337 mi/h) due to the heavy presence of vehicles; in villages and towns, speeds are as low as 25\u201330 km/h (15\u201318 mi/h).The first passenger train in India ran from Mumbai to Thane on 16 April 1853.\nRail transportation is run by the Central Railway, Western Railway, South Central Railway, and South East Central Railway zones of the Indian Railways with the first two zones being headquartered in Mumbai, at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CSMT) and Churchgate respectively. Konkan Railway is headquartered in Navi Mumbai. The Mumbai Rajdhani Express, the fastest Rajdhani train, connects the Indian capital of New Delhi to Mumbai. Thane and CSMT are the busiest railway stations in India, the latter serving as a terminal for both long-distance trains and commuter trains of the Mumbai Suburban Railway.\nThe two principal seaports, Mumbai Port and Jawaharlal Nehru Port, which is also in the Mumbai region, are under the control and supervision of the government of India. There are around 48 minor ports in Maharashtra. Most of these handle passenger traffic and have a limited capacity. None of the major rivers in Maharashtra are navigable and so river transport does not exist in the state.\nChhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (formerly Bombay International Airport), is the state's largest airport. The four other international airports are Pune International Airport, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport at Nagpur, Nashik Airport, Shirdi Airport. Aurangabad Airport, Kolhapur Airport, Jalgaon Airport, and Nanded Airport are domestic airports in the state. Most of the State's airfields are operated by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) while Reliance Airport Developers (RADPL), currently operates five non-metro airports at Latur, Nanded, Baramati, Osmanabad and Yavatmal on a 95-year lease. The Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC) was set up in 2002 to take up development of airports in the state that are not under the AAI or the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC). MADC is playing the lead role in the planning and implementation of the Multi-modal International Cargo Hub and Airport at Nagpur (MIHAN) project. Additional smaller airports include Akola, Amravati, Chandrapur, Ratnagiri, and Solapur. Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (Maha Metro), headquartered in Nagpur is a Joint Venture establishment of Government of India & Government of Maharashtra headquartered in Nagpur, India. Maha Metro is responsible for the implementation of all Maharashtra state metro projects, except the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.

This usage includes private insurance and social insurance programs such as National Health Mission, which pools resources and spreads the financial risk associated with major medical expenses across the entire population to protect everyone, as well as social welfare programs such as National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and the Health Insurance Program, which assist people who cannot afford health coverage.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nAlthough its population makes Maharashtra one of the country's largest energy users, conservation mandates, mild weather in the largest population centres, and strong environmental movements have kept its per capita energy use to one of the smallest of any Indian state. The high electricity demand of the state constitutes 13 per cent of the total installed electricity generation capacity in India, which is mainly from fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas. Mahavitaran is responsible for the distribution of electricity throughout the state by buying power from Mahanirmiti, captive power plants, other state electricity boards, and private sector power generation companies.As of 2012, Maharashtra was the largest power generating state in India, with an installed electricity generation capacity of 26,838 MW. The state forms a major constituent of the western grid of India, which now comes under the North, East, West and North Eastern (NEWNE) grids of India. Maharashtra Power Generation Company (MAHAGENCO) operates thermal power plants. In addition to the state government-owned power generation plants, there are privately owned power generation plants that transmit power through the Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company, which is responsible for the transmission of electricity in the state.", "start_char_idx": 55321, "end_char_idx": 59131, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d867716-fd77-45ad-a36a-a2394f29e85e": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d867716-fd77-45ad-a36a-a2394f29e85e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Maharashtra.txt", "file_name": "Maharashtra.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 80638, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "80eef64e-d2ee-46cb-99e8-194a15d20fea", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Maharashtra.txt", "file_name": "Maharashtra.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 80638, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "23ab658ae1dc2f53285bf9a4ea59d3b772dab236298add907da9011bf79ed79a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd9993ea-14f9-4f55-ac99-5b23c89ed99b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Maharashtra.txt", "file_name": "Maharashtra.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 80638, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "f40ada2f18e7783819763a13bf250728b985289437816a5c43eece3d977ab85e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "911cad04-9750-48c9-9531-b9bd03d84355", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9ecd305e39f3b50643ab120a225f98b34142cb224ed60e96aeee3dffeb28a2ef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Environmental protection and sustainability ===\nMaharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) is established and responsible for implementing various environmental legislations in the state principally including the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, Water (Cess) Act, 1977 and some of the provisions under Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986 and the rules framed there under it including, Biomedical Waste (M&H) Rules, 1998, Hazardous Waste (M&H) Rules, 2000, and Municipal Solid Waste Rules, 2000.

Wheat, rice, jowar, bajri, vegetables, lentils and fruit form staple food of the Maharashtrian diet. Some of the popular traditional dishes include puran poli, ukdiche modak, Thalipeeth. Street food items like Batata wada, Misal Pav, Pav Bhaji and Vada pav are very popular among the locals and are usually sold on stalls and in small hotels. Meals (mainly lunch and dinner) are served on a plate called thali. Each food item served on the thali is arranged in a specific way. All non-vegetarian and vegetarian dishes are eaten with boiled rice, chapatis or with bhakris, made of jowar, bajra or rice flours. A typical vegetarian thali is made of chapati or bhakri (Indian flat bread), dal, rice (varan bhaat), amti, bhaji or usal, chutney, koshimbir (salad) and buttermilk or Sol kadhi. A bhaji is a vegetable dish made of a particular vegetable or combination of vegetables. Aamti is variant of the curry, typically consisting of a lentil (tur) stock, flavoured with goda masala and sometimes with tamarind or amshul, and jaggery (gul). Varan is nothing but plain dal, a common Indian lentil stew. More or less, most of the dishes use coconut, onion, garlic, ginger, red chili powder, green chilies, and mustard though some section of the population traditionally avoid onion and garlics.Maharashtrian cuisine varies with the regions. Malvani (Konkani), Kolhapuri, and Varhadhi cuisins are examples of well known regional cuisines. Kolhapur is famous for Tambda Pandhra rassa, a dish made of either chicken or mutton. Rice and seafood are the staple foods of the coastal Konkani people. Among seafood, the most popular is a fish variety called the Bombay duck (also known as bombil in Marathi).", "start_char_idx": 59134, "end_char_idx": 61821, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "911cad04-9750-48c9-9531-b9bd03d84355": {"__data__": {"id_": "911cad04-9750-48c9-9531-b9bd03d84355", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Maharashtra.txt", "file_name": "Maharashtra.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 80638, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "80eef64e-d2ee-46cb-99e8-194a15d20fea", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Maharashtra.txt", "file_name": "Maharashtra.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 80638, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "23ab658ae1dc2f53285bf9a4ea59d3b772dab236298add907da9011bf79ed79a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7d867716-fd77-45ad-a36a-a2394f29e85e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Maharashtra.txt", "file_name": "Maharashtra.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 80638, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "12dca9f601754de5013a1cddea226fe2c507675099bd780d3702afbe05625b72", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "16db4122-7ce7-4970-b512-0dce3e10b824", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b3213f97cc650dcdd8d9dda115e3d8eb985306a1522dc75392febc0c0c91219e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Attire ===\nTraditionally, Marathi women commonly wore the sari, often distinctly designed according to local cultural customs. Most middle-aged and young women in urban Maharashtra dress in western outfits such as skirts and trousers or shalwar kameez with the traditionally nauvari or nine-yard lugade, disappearing from the markets due to a lack of demand. Older women wear the five-yard sari. In urban areas, the five-yard sari, especially the Paithani, is worn by younger women for special occasions such as marriages and religious ceremonies. Among men, western dressing has greater acceptance. Men also wear traditional costumes such as the dhoti, and pheta on cultural occasions. The Gandhi cap is the popular headgear among older men in rural Maharashtra. Women wear traditional jewellery derived from Maratha and Peshwa dynasties. Kolhapuri saaj, a special type of necklace, is also worn by Marathi women. In urban areas, western attire is dominant amongst women and men.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nMaharashtra and Maharashtrian artists have been influential in preserving and developing Hindustani classical music for more than a century. Notable practitioners of Kirana or Gwalior style called Maharashtra their home. The Sawai Gandharva Bhimsen Festival in Pune started by Bhimsen Joshi in the 1950s is considered the most prestigious Hindustani music festival in India, if not one of the largest.Cities like Kolhapur and Pune have been playing a major role in the preservation of music like Bhavageet and Natya Sangeet, which are inherited from Indian classical music. The biggest form of Indian popular music is songs from films produced in Mumbai. Film music, in 2009 made up 72 per cent of the music sales in India. Most the influential music composers and singers have called Mumbai their home.\nIn recent decades, the music scene in Maharashtra, and particularly in Mumbai has seen a growth of newer music forms such as rap. The city also holds festivals in western music genres such as blues. In 2006, the Symphony Orchestra of India was founded, housed at the NCPA in Mumbai. It is today the only professional symphony orchestra in India and presents two concert seasons per year, with world-renowned conductors and soloists.\nMaharashtra has a long and rich tradition of folk music. Some of the most common forms of folk music in practice are Bhajan, Bharud, Kirtan, Gondhal, and Koli Geet.\n\n\n=== Dance ===\nMarathi dance forms draw from folk traditions. Lavani is popular form of dance in the state. The Bhajan, Kirtan and Abhangas of the Warkari sect (Vaishanav Devotees) have a long history and are part of their daily rituals. Koli dance (called 'Koligeete') is among the most popular dances of Maharashtra. As the name suggests, it is related to the fisher folk of Maharashtra, who are called Kolis. Popular for their unique identity and liveliness, their dances represent their occupation. This type of dance is represented by both men and women. While dancing, they are divided into groups of two.

It is bounded by the Indian states of Nagaland to the north, Mizoram to the south and Assam to the west. It also borders two regions of Myanmar, Sagaing Region to the east and Chin State to the south. The state covers an area of 22,327 km2 (8,621 sq mi). The official and most widely spoken language is the Meitei language (officially known as Manipuri). Native to the Meitei people, it is also used as a lingua franca by smaller communities, who speak a variety of other Tibeto-Burman languages. Manipur has been at the crossroads of Asian economic and cultural exchange for more than 2,500 years. This exchange connects the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia to Southeast Asia, East Asia, Siberia, regions in the Arctic, Micronesia and Polynesia enabling migration of people, cultures and religions.During the days of the British Raj, the Kingdom of Manipur was one of the princely states. Between 1917 and 1939, some people of Manipur pressed the princely rulers for democracy. By the late 1930s, the princely state of Manipur negotiated with the British administration its preference to continue to be part of the British Raj rather than part of British-ruled Burma, which was being separated from India. These negotiations were cut short with the outbreak of World War II in 1939. On 11 August 1947, Maharaja Budhachandra signed an Instrument of Accession, joining the new Indian Union. Later, on 21 September 1949, he signed a Merger Agreement, merging the kingdom into India, which led to its becoming a Part C State. This merger was later disputed by groups in Manipur, as having been completed without consensus and under duress. The dispute and differing visions for the future has resulted in a 50-year insurgency in the state for independence from India, as well as in repeated episodes of violence among ethnic groups in the state. From 2009 through 2018, the conflict was responsible for the violent deaths of over 1000 people.The Meitei people represent around 53% of the population of Manipur state, followed by various Naga ethnic groups at 24% and various Kuki/Zo tribes (also known as Chin-Kuki-Mizo people) at 16%. Manipur's ethnic groups practice a variety of religions. According to 2011 census, Hinduism and Christianity are the major religions of the state.

Thus, \"Manipur\" may be translated as \"Jewelled land\".Manipur is mentioned in older texts as \"Kangleipak\" (Meitei: \uabc0\uabea\uabc2\uabe9\uabc4\uabdb) or \"Meeteileipak\". Sanamahi Laikan wrote that officials during the reign of Meidingu Pamheiba in the eighteenth century adopted Manipur's new name.\nNeighbouring cultures each had differing names for Manipur and its people. The Shan or Pong called the area Cassay; the Bamars Kathe, and the Assamese Meklee. In the first treaty between the British East India Company and Meidingu Ching-Thang Khomba (Bhagyachandra), signed in 1762, the kingdom was referred to as \"Meckley\". Bhagyachandra and his successors issued coins engraved with \"Manipureshwar\", or \"lord of Manipur\", and the British soon discarded the name of Meckley. Later, the work Dharani Samhita (1825\u201334) popularised the Sanskrit legends of the origin of Manipur's name.The term Kanglei, meaning \"of Manipur/Kangleipak\", is used to refer to items associated with the state where the term Manipuri is a recently given name.\n\n\n== History ==", "start_char_idx": 2886, "end_char_idx": 4076, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6183672-abd4-422b-9868-636ea4d26a8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c6183672-abd4-422b-9868-636ea4d26a8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Manipur.txt", "file_name": "Manipur.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46185, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0167f5a0-6690-4d0a-803a-3883d97f9636", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Manipur.txt", "file_name": "Manipur.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46185, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "2d5d1bb3d2a96416a3e65907285685222e6325089d2c70e395e11fe424c4d2be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7b7866c-21dd-4ed3-a18e-d954e776bd32", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Manipur.txt", "file_name": "Manipur.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46185, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "642a45dacab9740ceff0235c7a18a15970c9528cd35dbc551b83c5412d351682", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "23584943-a41d-4cbf-8f8d-b545b07f59d2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe38f93c6c5a61ce970bdf2a2634f08f4804b24329b076949c57144b6aa5ac50", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nThe history of Manipur Meiteis is chronicled in Puyas or Puwaris (stories about the forefathers), namely, the Ninghthou Kangbalon, Cheitharol Kumbaba, Ningthourol Lambuba, Poireiton Khunthokpa, Panthoibi Khongkul, and so forth in the Meitei script, which is comparable to the Thai script. The historical accounts presented here were recordings from the eyes and the judgment of Meitei kings and Maichou (Meitei scholars). Hill tribes have folk tales, myths, and legends. Manipur was known by different names at various periods in its history, such as Tilli-Koktong, Poirei-Lam, Sanna-Leipak, Mitei-Leipak, Meitrabak or Manipur (present day). Its capital was Kangla, Yumphal or Imphal (present day). Its people were known by various names, such as Mi-tei, Poirei-Mitei, Meetei, Maitei or Meitei. The Puwaris, Ninghthou Kangbalon, Ningthourol Lambuba, Cheitharol Kumbaba, Poireiton Khunthokpa, recorded the events of each King who ruled Manipur over more than 3500 years until 1955 CE (a total of more than 108 kings).According to the Tai chronicles, Manipur (Kahse) is one of the territories conquered by Samlongpha (1150\u20131201), the first Chao Pha of Mogaung. A 14th-century inscription from Pagan, Myanmar, mentions Kasan (Manipur) as one of the 21 states under the Mong Mao ruler Thonganbwa (1413\u20131445/6); he later was captured by the Governor of Taungdwingyi. Ningthou Kangba (15th century BCE) is regarded as the first and foremost king of Manipur. There were times when the country was in turmoil without rulers, and long historical gaps exist between 1129 BCE and 44 BCE.\nIn 1891 CE, as a result of the British defeat of the Meiteis in the Anglo-Manipuri war of Khongjom, Manipur lost the sovereignty which it had maintained for more than three millennia. From 1926 until 4 January 1947, Manipur was just one of the Pakokku Hill Tracts Districts of British Burma. Manipur regained its separate identity on 14 August 1947 and, on 15 October 1949, was unified with India.\n\n\n=== Medieval ===\n\nBy the medieval period, marriage alliances between the royal families of Manipur, Ahom kingdom and Burma had become common. Medieval era manuscripts discovered in the 20th century, particularly the Puya, provide evidence that Hindus from the Indian subcontinent had married Manipur royalty by at least the 14th century. In centuries thereafter, royal spouses came also from what is now Assam, Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh and from other South Indian kingdoms as well. Another manuscript suggests that Muslims arrived in Manipur in the 17th century, from what is now Bangladesh, during the reign of Meidingu Khagemba. The socio-political turmoil and wars, particularly the persistent and devastating Anglo-Burmese wars, affected the cultural and religious demography of Manipur.", "start_char_idx": 4063, "end_char_idx": 6867, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23584943-a41d-4cbf-8f8d-b545b07f59d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "23584943-a41d-4cbf-8f8d-b545b07f59d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Manipur.txt", "file_name": "Manipur.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46185, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0167f5a0-6690-4d0a-803a-3883d97f9636", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Manipur.txt", "file_name": "Manipur.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46185, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "2d5d1bb3d2a96416a3e65907285685222e6325089d2c70e395e11fe424c4d2be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c6183672-abd4-422b-9868-636ea4d26a8c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Manipur.txt", "file_name": "Manipur.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46185, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "92177a6e6c007b815e13247733c99455bdc3f813c9bd21afe40f76f212e17221", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "214b30dd-9534-4e97-825b-fb10273c81e9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1efbfbaac87370feb116a977aef5363acafd695fb799c603eac84e380d597988", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== British colonial period ===\n\nIn 1824, the ruler of Manipur entered into a subsidiary alliance with the British Empire in the Indian subcontinent, which became responsible for Manipur's external defence. The British recognised that the state remained internally self-governing, as a princely state. During World War II, Manipur was the scene of many fierce battles between Japanese invaders and British Indian forces. The Japanese were beaten back before they could enter Imphal, which was one of the turning points of the overall war in South Asia. The Battle of Imphal, known to the Manipuris as Japan Laan, are among the lesser-known battles of the Second World War. Yet the Allied Victory in this battle was a turning point against the Japanese in East Asia.\n\n\n=== Post-colonial history ===\n\nAfter the war, India moved towards independence, and the princely states which had existed alongside it became responsible for their own external affairs and defence, unless they joined the new Indian Union or Pakistan. The Manipur State Constitution Act of 1947 established a democratic form of government, with the Maharaja continuing as the head of state. Maharaja Bodhchandra was summoned to Shillong, to merge the kingdom into the Union of India. He is believed to have signed the merger agreement under duress. Thereafter, the legislative assembly was dissolved, and in October 1949 Manipur became part of India. It was made a Union Territory in 1956. and a fully-fledged state in 1972 by the North-Eastern Areas (Reorganisation) Act, 1971.\nManipur has a long record of insurgency and inter-ethnic violence. Its first armed opposition group, the United National Liberation Front (UNLF), was founded in 1964 aiming to achieve independence from India and establish Manipur as a new country. Over time, many more groups formed, each with different goals, and deriving support from diverse ethnic groups in Manipur. The People's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (PREPAK) was formed in 1977, and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in 1978, suspected by Human Rights Watch of receiving arms and training from China. In 1980, the Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP) was formed. These groups began a spree of bank robberies and attacks on police officers and government buildings. The state government appealed to the central government in New Delhi for support in combating this violence.\n\n\n==== \"Disturbed area\" designation ====\nFrom 1980 to 2004, the Indian government referred to Manipur as a disturbed area. This term (designated by the Ministry of Home Affairs or a state governor) refers to a territory where extraordinary laws under the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act can be used. The laws allow the military to treat private and public spaces in the same manner, detain individuals for up to 24 hours with unlimited renewals, perform warrantless searches, and to shoot and kill individuals who break laws, carry weapons, or gather in groups larger than four. Legal immunity applies to the military. Since 1980, the application of AFSPA has been at the heart of concerns about human rights violations in the region, such as arbitrary killings, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and forced disappearances. Its continued application has led to numerous protests, notably the longstanding hunger strike by Irom Sharmila Chanu.In 2004, the government lifted the disturbed status after a violent attack on a local woman. The rape of a Manipuri woman, Thangjam Manorama Devi, by members of the Assam Rifles paramilitary had led to wide protests including a nude protest by the Meira Paibi women's association.", "start_char_idx": 6870, "end_char_idx": 10494, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "214b30dd-9534-4e97-825b-fb10273c81e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "214b30dd-9534-4e97-825b-fb10273c81e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Manipur.txt", "file_name": "Manipur.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46185, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0167f5a0-6690-4d0a-803a-3883d97f9636", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Manipur.txt", "file_name": "Manipur.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46185, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "2d5d1bb3d2a96416a3e65907285685222e6325089d2c70e395e11fe424c4d2be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "23584943-a41d-4cbf-8f8d-b545b07f59d2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Manipur.txt", "file_name": "Manipur.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46185, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "e01470424a6ae73adea8e0195c62ff422feecd2c99df494a1b228f4d7f4e2db3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e347a2cc-66e0-451e-a329-21f463274111", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f6b405c664597dbdda3adae2bea8bcf1a8fd9774ea75fadca461a295cb5476eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "==== 2023 ethnic violence ====\n\nIn May 2023, an ethnic clash between Meitei people and Kuki people led to extensive violence and arson, resulting in 60,000 people displaced from their homes and hundreds more dead and hospitalized.

The total area covered by the state is 22,327 km2 (8,621 sq mi). The capital lies in an oval-shaped valley of approximately 700 sq mi (2,000 km2), surrounded by blue mountains, at an elevation of 790 m (2,590 ft) above sea level. The slope of the valley is from north to south. The mountain ranges create a moderate climate, preventing the cold winds from the north from reaching the valley and barring cyclonic storms.The state is bordered by the Indian states of Nagaland to its north, Mizoram to its south, Assam to its west, and shares an international border with Myanmar to its east.\nThe state has four major river basins: the Barak River Basin (Barak Valley) to the west, the Manipur River Basin in central Manipur, the Yu River Basin in the east, and a portion of the Lanye River Basin in the north. The water resources of Barak and Manipur river basins are about 1.8487 Mham (million hectare metres). The overall water balance of the state amounts to 0.7236 Mham in the annual water budget. (By comparison, India receives 400 Mham of rain annually.)\nThe Barak River, the largest of Manipur, originates in the Manipur Hills and is joined by tributaries, such as the Irang, Maku, and Tuivai. After its junction with the Tuivai, the Barak River turns north, forms the border with Assam State, and then enters the Cachar Assam just above Lakhipur. The Manipur river basin has eight major rivers: the Manipur, Imphal, Iril, Nambul, Sekmai, Chakpi, Thoubal and Khuga. All these rivers originate from the surrounding hills.\nAlmost all the rivers in the valley area are in the mature stage and therefore deposit their sediment load in the Loktak Lake. The rivers draining the Manipur Hills are comparatively young, due to the hilly terrain through which they flow. These rivers are corrosive and become turbulent in the rainy season. Important rivers draining the western area include the Maku, Barak, Jiri, Irang, and Leimatak. Rivers draining the eastern part of the state, the Yu River Basin, include the Chamu, Khunou and other short streams.Manipur may be characterised as two distinct physical regions: an outlying area of rugged hills and narrow valleys, and the inner area of flat plain, with all associated landforms. These two areas are distinct in physical features and are conspicuous in flora and fauna. The valley region has hills and mounds rising above the flat surface. The Loktak Lake is an important feature of the central plain. The total area occupied by all the lakes is about 600 km2. The altitude ranges from 40 m at Jiribam to 2,994 m at Mount Temp\u00fc peak along the border with Nagaland.\nThe soil cover can be divided into two broad types, viz. the red ferruginous soil in the hill area and the alluvium in the valley. The valley soils generally contain loam, small rock fragments, sand, and sandy clay, and are varied. On the plains, especially flood plains and deltas, the soil is quite thick. The topsoil on the steep slopes is very thin. Soil on the steep hill slopes is subject to high erosion, resulting in gullies and barren rock slopes.

About a third of Manipur's forests are protected: 8.42% of the forested land is categorized under Reserved Forests, and 23.95 % under Protected Forests.There are six major types of forests in Manipur, and 10 subtypes. The six major forest types, according to the state's Forest Department, include Tropical Wet Evergreen Forest, Tropical Moist Deciduous Forests, Sub-Tropical Pine Forest, Tropical Dry Deciduous Forest, Montane Wet Temperate Forest and Sub-alpine Forest.There are forests of teak, pine, oak, uningthou, leihao, bamboo, and cane. Rubber, tea, coffee, orange, and cardamom are grown in hill areas. Rice is a staple food for Manipuris.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nManipur's climate is largely influenced by the topography of the region. Lying 790 metres above sea level, Manipur is wedged among hills on all sides. This northeastern corner of India enjoys a generally amiable climate, though the winters can be chilly. The maximum temperature in the summer months is 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F). The coldest month is January, and the warmest July.The state receives an average annual rainfall of 1,467.5 mm (57.78 in) between April and mid-October. Precipitation ranges from light drizzle to heavy downpour. The capital city Imphal receives an annual average of 933 mm (36.7 in). Rainfall in this region is caused by The South Westerly Monsoon picking up moisture from the Bay of Bengal and heading towards the Eastern Himalaya ranges. This normal rainfall pattern of Manipur enriches the soil and much of the agrarian activities are dependent on it as well.\nManipur is already experiencing climate change, especially changes in weather, with both increased variability in rain as well as increasingly severe changes in temperature.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nManipur has a population of 2,855,794 as per 2011 census. Of this total, 57.2% live in the valley districts and the remaining 42.8% in the hill districts. The valley (plain) is mainly inhabited by the Meitei speaking population (native Manipuri speakers). The hills are inhabited mainly by several ethno-linguistically diverse tribes belonging to the Nagas, the Kukis and smaller tribal groupings. Naga and Kuki settlements are also found in the valley region, though less in numbers.

A copper plate excavated from Phayeng dating back to 763 CE (believed to be of the reign of Meitei King Khongtekcha) was found to contain inscriptions about the Hindu deities in Sanskrit words. During the 13th century, Meitei King Khumomba constructed a Lord Hanuman temple. The Vishnu temple at Lamangdong was constructed during 1474 CE (during the reign of Meitei King Kiyamba), by Brahmins immigrating from the neighborhood Shan State.

There is violence between the Meitei ethnicity, various Naga tribes, various Kuki tribes, and other tribal groups.Splinter groups have arisen within some of the armed groups, and disagreement between them is rife. Other than the UNLF, PLA, and PREPAK, Manipuri insurgent groups include the Revolutionary Peoples Front (RPF), Manipur Liberation Front Army (MLFA), Kanglei Yawol Kanba Lup (KYKL), Revolutionary Joint Committee (RJC), Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP), Peoples United Liberation Front (PULF), Manipur Naga People Front (MNPF), National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-K), National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-I/M), United Kuki Liberation Front (UKLF), Kuki National Front (KNF), Kuki National Army (KNA), Kuki Defence Force (KDF), Kuki Democratic Movement (KDM), Kuki National Organisation (KNO), Kuki Security Force (KSF), Chin Kuki Revolutionary Front (CKRF), Kom Rem Peoples Convention (KRPC), Zomi Revolutionary Volunteers (ZRV), Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA), Zomi Reunification Organisation (ZRO), and Hmar Peoples Convention (HPC).The Meitei insurgent groups seek independence from India. The Kuki insurgent groups want a separate state for the Kukis to be carved out from the present state of Manipur. The Kuki insurgent groups are under two umbrella organisations: the Kuki National Organisation (KNO) and United Peoples Forum. The Nagas wish to annex part of Manipur and merge with a greater Nagaland or Nagalim, which is in conflict with Meitei insurgent demands for the integrity of their vision of an independent state. There have been many tensions between the tribes and numerous clashes between Naga and Kukis, Meiteis and Muslims.According to SATP in 2014, there had been a dramatic decline in fatalities in Manipur since 2009. In 2009, 77 civilians died (about 3 per 100,000 people).

However, there were 76 explosions in 2013 compared to 107 in 2012. Different groups have claimed responsibility for the explosions, some claiming they were targeting competing militant groups, others claiming their targets were state and central government officials. \nAs a point of comparison, the average annual global rate of violent death between 2004 and 2009 was 7.9 per 100,000 people.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe 2012\u20132013 gross state domestic product of Manipur at market prices was about \u20b910,188 crore (US$1.3 billion). Its economy is primarily agriculture, forestry, cottage and trade driven. Manipur acts as India's \"Gateway to the East\" through Moreh and Tamu towns, the land route for trade between India and Burma and other countries in Southeast Asia, East Asia, Siberia, the Arctic, Micronesia and Polynesia.

The state has hydroelectric power generation potential, estimated to be over 2 GWh (7.2 TJ). As of 2010, if half of this potential is realised, it is estimated that this would supply 24/7 electricity to all residents, with a surplus for sale, as well as supplying the Burma power grid.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nManipur's climate and soil conditions make it ideally suited for horticultural crops. Growing there are rare and exotic medicinal and aromatic plants. Some cash crops suited for Manipur include Lychee, Cashew, Walnut, Orange, Lemon, Pineapple, Papaya, Passion Fruit, Peach, Pear and Plum. The state is covered with over 3,000 km2 (1,200 sq mi) of bamboo forests, making it one of India's largest contributor to its bamboo industry.Agriculture in Manipur includes a number of smallholding farms, many of whom are owned by women. Climate change, especially changes in temperature and weather are hurting small farmers in the state. Like rural women in other parts of the world, women in agriculture in Manipur are harmed more by the changes in weather, because of less access to support from local governments.\n\n\n=== Transportation infrastructure ===\nTulihal Airport, Changangei, Imphal, the only airport of Manipur, connects directly with Delhi, Kolkata, Guwahati, and Agartala. It has been upgraded to an international airport. As India's second largest airport in the northeast, it serves as a key logistical centre for northeastern states. The Tulihal Airport has been renamed Bir Tikendrajit Airport. National Highway NH-39 links Manipur with the rest of the country through the railway stations at Dimapur in Nagaland at a distance of 215 km (134 mi) from Imphal.National Highway 53 (India) connects Manipur with another railway station at Silchar in Assam, which is 269 km (167 mi) away from Imphal. The road network of Manipur, with a length of 7,170 km (4,460 mi) connects all the important towns and distant villages. However, the road condition throughout the state is often deplorable. In 2010, Indian government announced that it is considering an Asian infrastructure network from Manipur to Vietnam. The proposed Trans-Asian Railway (TAR), if constructed, will pass through Manipur, connecting India to Burma, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nThe tourist season is from October to February when it is often sunny without being hot and humid. The culture features martial arts, dance, theatre and sculpture. Greenery accompanies a moderate climate. The seasonal Shirui Lily plant at Ukhrul (district), Dz\u00fcko Valley at Senapati, Sangai (Brow antlered deer) and the floating islands at Loktak Lake are among the rarities of the area.

In these are Shumang lila and Phampak lila (stage drama). Shumang lila is very popular. Etymologically Shumang lila is the combination of \"Shumang\" (courtyard) and \"Lila\" (play or performance). It is performed in an area of 13\u00d713 ft in the centre of any open space, in a very simple style without a raised stage, set design, or heavy props such as curtains, background scenery, and visual effects. It uses one table and two chairs, kept on one side of the performance space. Its claim as the \"theatre of the masses\" is underlined by the way it is performed in the middle of an audience that surrounds it, leaving one passage as entrance and exit.The world of Phampak lila (stage drama) performed in the proscenium theatre is similar, in form, to the Western theatrical model and Indian Natyasastra model though its contents are indigenous. The so-called modern theatre descended on Manipur theatre culture with the performance of Pravas Milan (1902) under the enthusiastic patronage of Sir Churchand Maharaj (1891\u20131941). The pace of theatrical movement was geared up with the institution of groups such as Manipur Dramatic Union (MDU) (1930), Arian Theatre (1935), Chitrangada Natya Mandir (1936), Society Theatre (1937), Rupmahal (1942), Cosmopolitan Dramatic Union (1968), and the Chorus Repertory Theatre of Ratan Thiyam (1976). These groups started experimenting with types of plays apart from historical and Puranic ones. Today Manipur theatre is well respected because of excellent productions shown in India and abroad. Manipur plays, both Shumang lila and stage lila, have been a regular feature in the annual festival of the National School of Drama, New Delhi.Iskcon led by Bhaktisvarupa Damodara Swami started a network of schools in Northeastern India, where more than 4,000 students receive education centred on Vaishnava spiritual values. In 1989 he founded \"Ranganiketan Manipuri Cultural Arts Troupe\", which has approximately 600 performances at over 300 venues in over 15 countries. Ranganiketan (literally \"House of Colorful Arts\") is a group of more than 20 dancers, musicians, singers, martial artists, choreographers, and craft artisans. Some of them have received international acclaim.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Manipur dance (Ras Lila) ===\n\nManipuri dance also known as Jagoi, is one of the major Indian classical dance forms, named after the state of Manipur. It is particularly known for its Hindu Vaishnavism themes, and exquisite performances of love-inspired dance drama of Radha-Krishna called Raslila. However, the dance is also performed to themes related to Shaivism, Shaktism and regional deities such as Umang Lai during Lai Haraoba.

Yubi lakpi literally means \"coconut snatching\". The coconut is greased to make it slippery. There are rules of the game, as with all Manipur sports. The coconut serves the purpose of a ball and is offered to the king, the chief guest or the judges before the game begins. The aim is to run while carrying the greased coconut and physically cross over the goal line, while the other team tackles and blocks any such attempt as well as tries to grab the coconut and score on its own. In Manipur's long history, Yubi lakpi was the annual official game, attended by the king, over the Hindu festival of Shree Govindajee. It is like the game of rugby, or American football.Oolaobi (Woo-Laobi) is an outdoor game mainly played by females. Meitei mythology believes that UmangLai Heloi-Taret (seven deities\u2013seven fairies) played this game on the Courtyard of the temple of Umang Lai Lairembi. The number of participants is not fixed but are divided into two groups (size as per agreement). Players are divided as into Raiders (Attackers) or Defenders (Avoiders). Hiyang Tannaba, also called Hi Yangba Tanaba, is a traditional boat rowing race and festivity of the Panas.\n\n\n=== Polo ===\n\nThe origin of modern polo can be traced to Manipur where the world's oldest polo ground lies, Imphal Polo Ground. Captain Robert Stewart and Lieutenant Joseph Sherer of the British colonial era first watched locals play a rules-based pulu or sagolkangjei (literally, horse and stick) game in 1859. They adopted its rules, calling the game polo, and playing it on their horses. The game spread among the British in Calcutta and then to England.Apart from these games, some outdoor children's games are fading in popularity. Some games such as Khutlokpi, Phibul Thomba, and Chaphu Thugaibi remain very popular elsewhere, such as in Cambodia. They are played especially during the Khmer New Year.First of its kind in India, National Sports University will be constructed in Manipur.", "start_char_idx": 38566, "end_char_idx": 41622, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ab92720-9b3b-4119-b558-1dbdc5f03df4": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ab92720-9b3b-4119-b558-1dbdc5f03df4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Manipur.txt", "file_name": "Manipur.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46185, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0167f5a0-6690-4d0a-803a-3883d97f9636", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Manipur.txt", "file_name": "Manipur.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46185, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "2d5d1bb3d2a96416a3e65907285685222e6325089d2c70e395e11fe424c4d2be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5d5bc746-4cbc-4b59-9f5c-6794829be4d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Manipur.txt", "file_name": "Manipur.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46185, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "466b49d62ad6382e8113666b5101c7e186831471da50d81f21b6f53558444433", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "51dc62b1-7f9a-4a13-83e0-cdcd3368778c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bdefca1e0f090da9535bae5bd75ebb872cb1b5c80301db0aabe92b85bd95d09d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Festivals ==\nThe festivals of Manipur are Lui-ngai-ni Ningol Chakouba, Shirui Lily festival, Yaoshang, Gan-ngai, Chumpha, Cheiraoba, Kang and Heikru Hidongba, as well as the broader religious festivals Eid-Ul-Fitr, Eid-Ul-Adha and Christmas.

Meghalaya was formed on 21 January 1972 by carving out two districts from the state of Assam: (a) the United Khasi Hills and Jaintia Hills and (b) the Garo Hills. The estimated population of Meghalaya in 2014 was 3,211,474. Meghalaya covers an area of approximately 22,429 square kilometres, with a length-to-breadth ratio of about 3:1.The state is bound to the south by the Bangladeshi divisions of Mymensingh and Sylhet, to the west by the Bangladeshi division of Rangpur, and to the north and east by India's State of Assam. The capital of Meghalaya is Shillong. During the British rule of India, the British imperial authorities nicknamed it the \"Scotland of the East\". English is the official language of Meghalaya. Unlike many Indian states, Meghalaya has historically followed a matrilineal system where the lineage and inheritance are traced through women; the youngest daughter inherits all wealth and she also takes care of her parents.The state is the wettest region of India, with the wettest areas in the southern Khasi Hills recording an average of 12,000 mm (470 in) of rain a year. About 70 per cent of the state is forested. The Meghalaya subtropical forests ecoregion encompasses the state; its mountain forests are distinct from the lowland tropical forests to the north and south. The forests are notable for their biodiversity of mammals, birds, and plants.\nMeghalaya has predominantly an agrarian economy with a significant commercial forestry industry. The important crops are potatoes, rice, maize, pineapples, bananas, papayas, and spices. The service sector is made up of real estate and insurance companies. Meghalaya's gross state domestic product for 2012 was estimated at \u20b916,173 crore (US$2.0 billion) in current prices. The state is geologically rich in minerals, but it has no significant industries. The state has about 1,170 km (730 mi) of national highways. It is also a major logistical center for trade with Bangladesh.In July 2018, the International Commission on Stratigraphy divided the Holocene epoch into three, with the late Holocene being called the Meghalayan stage/age, since a speleothem in Mawmluh cave indicating a dramatic worldwide climate event around 2250 BCE had been chosen as the boundary stratotype.One of the biggest Central Institutes, the North Eastern Council Secretariat, is also situated in Shillong.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word Megh\u0101laya means \"the abode of clouds\"; derives from a compound of the Sanskrit words megha \"cloud\" + \u0101laya \"abode\".\n\n\n== History ==\nMeghalaya, alongside neighbouring Indian states, has been of archaeological interest. People have lived in Meghalaya since the Neolithic period. Neolithic sites discovered so far are located in areas of high elevation in Khasi Hills, Garo Hills and in neighbouring states, where Neolithic style jhum or shifting cultivation is practised even today. The highland plateaus fed by abundant rains provided safety from floods and a rich soil. The importance of Meghalaya is its possible role in human history via domestication of rice. A theory for the origin of rice is by Ian Glover while states, \"India is the center of greatest diversity of domesticated rice with over 20,000 identified species and Northeast India is the most favorable single area of the origin of domesticated rice.\"", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3385, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d02b011-da56-489b-83e7-4c66508c8e2a": {"__data__": {"id_": "6d02b011-da56-489b-83e7-4c66508c8e2a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5fd34641-7f78-467f-ad9c-98bfaf757e17", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "f0e0db0b595f3f106903c1897db9ab138221c888cb5cb0015af6c1335357b97e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "395dd8dd-87d1-40ad-99a0-c55684300306", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "055b51e751e265814c10883b1fda36510a9ba49eec9721d30565a392953e55cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0396e973-29ce-49ff-9533-1984ddfb1f14", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "323b5235ee50cfc5e94dacc6573e2a5c201766cce3a69f2243c8a9c481a5af22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The importance of Meghalaya is its possible role in human history via domestication of rice. A theory for the origin of rice is by Ian Glover while states, \"India is the center of greatest diversity of domesticated rice with over 20,000 identified species and Northeast India is the most favorable single area of the origin of domesticated rice.\" The limited archaeology done in the hills of Meghalaya suggest human settlement since ancient times.After the Conquest of Taraf in 1304, Shah Arifin Rafiuddin, a disciple of Shah Jalal, migrated and settled in the Khasi and Jaintia Hills where he preached Islamic monotheism to the local people. His khanqah remains in Sarping / Laurergarh on the Bangladeshi border but the part containing his mazar is in Meghalaya on top of Laur Hill.Bhaitbari is an archaeological site first discovered and excavated by A. K. Sharma in 1993, a fortification of burnt brick with mud core was discovered at Meghalaya - Assam border and is dated to 4th-8th century AD, the city has been speculated to have been one of the capital cities of Kamarupa.The British discovered Camellia sinensis (tea shrub) in 1834 in Assam and later companies started renting land from 1839 onwards.The Khasi, Garo, and Jaintia tribes had their own kingdoms until they came under British administration in the 19th century. Later, the British incorporated Meghalaya into Assam in 1835. The region enjoyed semi-independent status by virtue of a treaty relationship with the British Crown. When Bengal was partitioned on 16 October 1905 by Lord Curzon, Meghalaya became a part of the new province of Eastern Bengal and Assam. When the partition was reversed in 1912, Meghalaya became a part of the province of Assam. On 3 January 1921 in pursuance of Section 52A of the Government of India Act of 1919, the governor-general-in-council declared the areas now in Meghalaya, other than the Khasi states, as \"backward tracts.\" Subsequently, the British administration enacted the Government of India Act 1935, which regrouped the backward tracts into two categories: \"excluded\" and \"partially excluded\" areas.At the time of Indian independence in 1947, present-day Meghalaya constituted two districts of Assam and enjoyed limited autonomy within the state of Assam. A movement for a separate hill state began in 1960. On 11 September 1968, the Government of India announced a scheme for constituting an autonomous state within the state of Assam comprising certain areas specified in Part A of the table appended to paragraph 20 of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution. Accordingly, the Assam Reorganisation (Meghalaya) Act of 1969 was enacted for the formation of an autonomous state. Meghalaya was formed by carving out two districts from the state of Assam: the United Khasi Hills and Jaintia Hills, and the Garo Hills. The name 'Meghalaya' coined by geographer S.P. Chatterjee in 1936 was proposed and accepted for the new state. The Act came into effect on 2 April 1970, with the autonomous state having a 37-member legislature in accordance with the Sixth Schedule to the Indian constitution.\nIn 1971, the Parliament passed the North-Eastern Areas (Reorganisation) Act, 1971, which conferred full statehood on the autonomous state of Meghalaya.", "start_char_idx": 3039, "end_char_idx": 6294, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0396e973-29ce-49ff-9533-1984ddfb1f14": {"__data__": {"id_": "0396e973-29ce-49ff-9533-1984ddfb1f14", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5fd34641-7f78-467f-ad9c-98bfaf757e17", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "f0e0db0b595f3f106903c1897db9ab138221c888cb5cb0015af6c1335357b97e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6d02b011-da56-489b-83e7-4c66508c8e2a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "ab671db3a945e85b1083981c1e274a2ebd965c00be2e3734b8725efcb37c446e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6b1a18c6-f77f-44f0-9e3e-2c4b3555ab41", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f6cd38285a558e252f1753b44b5b04d1374141e7858e3b926e434146f16664d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Act came into effect on 2 April 1970, with the autonomous state having a 37-member legislature in accordance with the Sixth Schedule to the Indian constitution.\nIn 1971, the Parliament passed the North-Eastern Areas (Reorganisation) Act, 1971, which conferred full statehood on the autonomous state of Meghalaya. Meghalaya attained statehood on 21 January 1972, with a Legislative Assembly of its own.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMeghalaya is one of the Seven Sister States of northeast India. The state of Meghalaya is mountainous, with stretches of valley and highland plateaus, and it is geologically rich. It consists mainly of Archean rock formations. These rock formations contain rich deposits of valuable minerals like coal, limestone, uranium and sillimanite. The name Meghalaya was given by Shiba P. Chatterjee, a geography professor at Kolkata University.Meghalaya has many rivers. Most of these are rainfed and seasonal. The important rivers in the Garo Hills region are Ganol, Daring, Sanda, Bandra, Bugai, Dareng, Simsang, Nitai and the Bhupai. In the central and eastern sections of the plateau, the important rivers are Khri, Umtrew, Digaru, Umiam or Barapani, Kynshi (Jadukata), Umngi, Mawpa, Umiam Khwan, Umngot, Umkhen, Myntdu and Myntang. In the southern Khasi Hills region, these rivers have created deep gorges and several waterfalls.\nThe elevation of the plateau ranges between 150 m (490 ft) to 1,961 m (6,434 ft). The central part of the plateau comprising the Khasi Hills has the highest elevations, followed by the eastern section comprising the Jaintia Hills region. The highest point in Meghalaya is Shillong Peak, which is a prominent IAF station in the Khasi Hills overlooking the city of Shillong. It has an altitude of 1961 m. The Garo Hills region in the western section of the plateau is nearly plain. The highest point in the Garo Hills is Nokrek Peak with an altitude of 1515 m.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nWith the average annual rainfall as high as 12,000 mm (470 in) in some areas, Meghalaya is the wettest place on Earth. The western part of the plateau, comprising the Garo Hills region with lower elevations, experiences high temperatures for most of the year. The Shillong area, with the highest elevations, experiences generally low temperatures. The maximum temperature in this region rarely goes beyond 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), whereas sub-zero winter temperatures are common.\n\nThe town of Sohra (Cherrapunji) in the Khasi Hills south of capital Shillong holds the world record for most rain in a calendar month, while the village of Mawsynram, near Sohra (Cherrapunji), holds the record for the most rain in a year.\n\n\n=== Flora and fauna ===\n\nAbout 70% of the state is forested, of which 9,496 km2 (3,666 sq mi) is dense primary subtropical forest. The Meghalayan forests are considered to be among the richest botanical habitats of Asia. These forests receive abundant rainfall and support a vast variety of floral and faunal biodiversity. A small portion of the forest area in Meghalaya is under what are known as \"sacred groves\" (see Sacred groves of India). These are small pockets of an ancient forest that have been preserved by the communities for hundreds of years due to religious and cultural beliefs.", "start_char_idx": 5978, "end_char_idx": 9211, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b1a18c6-f77f-44f0-9e3e-2c4b3555ab41": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b1a18c6-f77f-44f0-9e3e-2c4b3555ab41", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5fd34641-7f78-467f-ad9c-98bfaf757e17", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "f0e0db0b595f3f106903c1897db9ab138221c888cb5cb0015af6c1335357b97e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0396e973-29ce-49ff-9533-1984ddfb1f14", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "3ec3d92583aca03d1500fa2c2b213e07d7983ad56d1c775223023801f76746ea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dd8018ca-89ce-49b9-a0e8-5a5779685835", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a21f27d26f8e035da152b4b7f83019f2a941e09914098256b568c905bcfecd7d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These forests receive abundant rainfall and support a vast variety of floral and faunal biodiversity.

These are the Nongkhyllem Wildlife Sanctuary, the Siju Sanctuary, and the Baghmara Sanctuary, which is also the home of the insect-eating pitcher plant Nepenthes khasiana also called \"Me'mang Koksi\" in the Garo language.Due to diverse climatic and topographic conditions, Meghalaya forests support a vast floral diversity, including a large variety of parasites, epiphytes, succulent plants and shrubs. Two of the most important tree varieties are Shorea robusta (sal tree) and Tectona grandis (teak). Meghalaya is also the home to a large variety of fruits, vegetables, spices, and medicinal plants. Meghalaya is also famous for its large variety of orchids \u2014 nearly 325 of them. Of these, the largest variety is found in the Mawsmai, Mawmluh and Sohrarim forests in the Khasi hills.\n\nMeghalaya also has a large variety of mammals, birds, reptiles and insects. The important mammal species include elephants, bear, red pandas, small Indian civets, mongooses, weasels, rodents, gaur, wild buffalo, deer, wild boar and a number of primates.

Instruction is only in English. Other Indian languages like Assamese, Bengali, Garo, Hindi, Khasi, Mizo, Nepali and Urdu are taught as optional subjects. The secondary schools are affiliated with the council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), the National Institute of Open School (NIOS) or the Meghalaya Board of School Education.\nUnder the 10+2+3 plan, after completing secondary school, students typically enroll for two years in a junior college, also known as pre-university, or in schools with a higher secondary facility affiliated with the Meghalaya Board of School Education or any central board.

A Circuit Bench of the Guwahati High Court has been functioning at Shillong since 1974. In March 2013, the Meghalaya High Court was separated from the Gauhati High Court and now the state has its own High Court.\n\n\n=== Local self-government ===\nTo provide local self-governance machinery to the rural population of the country, provisions were made in the Constitution of India; accordingly, the Panchayati Raj institutions were set up. Because of distinct customs and traditions prevalent in the northeast region, it was felt necessary to have a separate political and administrative structure in the region. Some of the tribal communities in the region had their own traditional political systems, and it was felt that Panchayati Raj institutions may come into conflict with these traditional systems. The Sixth Schedule was appended to the Constitution on the recommendations of a subcommittee formed under the leadership of Gopinath Bordoloi, and the constitution of Autonomous District Councils is provided in certain rural areas of the northeast including areas in Meghalaya.\nThe ADCs in Meghalaya are the following:\n\nGaro Hills Autonomous District Council\nKhasi Hills Autonomous District Council\nJaintia Hills Autonomous District Council", "start_char_idx": 19943, "end_char_idx": 22915, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30f9ffdc-1d8e-4c6e-92df-ecc080d77ba0": {"__data__": {"id_": "30f9ffdc-1d8e-4c6e-92df-ecc080d77ba0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5fd34641-7f78-467f-ad9c-98bfaf757e17", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "f0e0db0b595f3f106903c1897db9ab138221c888cb5cb0015af6c1335357b97e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a3d2117-791d-4ec6-89d4-768b514ae9a4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "df36e8b744617e308779dfd51dfb50af58bd3cf82fc0494334ecae2069520ec8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "963de2f1-0f65-464c-aa04-e402a1636e44", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9dc88d8d3a87a1c8b65b5574de74a06082b560871e666fc4a06e1d4a0348b240", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Economy ==\nMeghalaya is predominantly an agrarian economy. Agriculture and allied activities engage nearly two-thirds of the total workforce in Meghalaya. This sector's contribution to the state's NSDP is about one-third. Agriculture in the state is characterised by low productivity and unsustainable farm practices. Despite the large percentage of the population engaged in agriculture, the state imports food from other Indian states. Infrastructural constraints have also prevented the economy of the state from creating high-income jobs at a pace commensurate with that of the rest of India.\nMeghalaya's gross state domestic product for 2012 was estimated at \u20b916,173 crore (US$2.0 billion) in current prices. As of 2012, according to the Reserve Bank of India, about 12% of total state population is below the poverty line, with 12.5% of the rural Meghalaya population is below the poverty line; while in urban areas, 9.3% are below the poverty line.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nMeghalaya is basically an agricultural state with about 80% of its population depending entirely on agriculture for their livelihood. Nearly 10% of the geographical area of Meghalaya is under cultivation. Agriculture in the state is characterised by limited use of modern techniques, low yields, and low productivity. As a result, despite the vast majority of the population being engaged in agriculture, the contribution of agricultural production to the state's GDP is low, and most of the population engaged in agriculture remain poor. A portion of the cultivated area is under the traditional shifting agriculture known locally as Jhum cultivation.\nMeghalaya produced 230,000 tonnes of food grains in 2001. Rice is the dominant food grain crop accounting for over 80% of the food grain production in the state. Other important food grain crops are maize, wheat, and a few other cereals and pulses. Besides these, potato, ginger, turmeric, black pepper, areca nut, Bay leaf (Cinnamomum tamala), betel, short-staple cotton, jute, mesta, mustard and rapeseed etc. are some of the important cash crops. Besides the major food crops of rice and maize, the state is renowned for its horticultural crops like orange, lemon, pineapple, guava, litchi, banana, jack fruits and fruits such as plum, pear, and peach.\nGrains and staples production covers about 60% of the land area dedicated to crops. With the introduction of different crops of high yielding varieties in the mid-1970s, a remarkable increase in food grain production has been made. A major breakthrough was achieved when high yielding varieties of paddy such as Masuri, Pankaj IR 8, RCPL and other improved varieties series \u2013 especially IR 36 which is suitable for Rabi season \u2013 allowing three crops to be grown every year. Another milestone was reached when Megha I and Megha II, which are cold tolerant rice varieties developed by the ICAR North East Region at Umroi near Shillong, was released in 1991\u201392 for the higher altitude regions where there was no high yielding rice varieties earlier. Today the state can claim that about 42% area under paddy has been covered with high yielding varieties with the average productivity of 2,300 kg/ha (2,100 lb/acre).", "start_char_idx": 22918, "end_char_idx": 26120, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "963de2f1-0f65-464c-aa04-e402a1636e44": {"__data__": {"id_": "963de2f1-0f65-464c-aa04-e402a1636e44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5fd34641-7f78-467f-ad9c-98bfaf757e17", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "f0e0db0b595f3f106903c1897db9ab138221c888cb5cb0015af6c1335357b97e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "30f9ffdc-1d8e-4c6e-92df-ecc080d77ba0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "1e3289a393309c3511f7b83f69e4164030138ffcf5dc8c60a71f13335bc892ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a50f9632-c76c-4df2-ab9e-a312c1766ce4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4e2a906a5acf9f32902156bdb0117684a16070feaa566635baef903d96c75b7e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Today the state can claim that about 42% area under paddy has been covered with high yielding varieties with the average productivity of 2,300 kg/ha (2,100 lb/acre).

Rape and mustard are the most important oilseeds accounting for well over two-thirds of the oilseed production of nearly 6.5 thousand tonnes. Fiber crops such as cotton, jute, and mesta are among the only cash crops in Meghalaya, grown in Garo Hills. These have been losing popularity in recent years as indicated by their declining yield and area under cultivation.\nClimatic conditions in Meghalaya permit a large variety of horticulture crops including fruits, vegetables, flowers, spices, mushrooms, and medicinal plants. These are considered to be higher value crops, but home food security concerns have prevented farmers at large from embracing them. The important fruits grown include citrus fruits, pineapples, papayas, and bananas. In addition to this, a large variety of vegetables are grown in the state, including cauliflower, cabbages, and radishes.\nAreca nut plantations can be seen all over the state, especially around the road from Guwahati to Shillong. Other plantation crops like tea, coffee and cashews have been introduced lately and are becoming common. A large variety of spices, flowers, medicinal plants and mushrooms are grown in the state.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\nMeghalaya has a rich base of natural resources. These include minerals such as coal, limestone, sillimanite, Kaolin and granite among others. Meghalaya has a large forest cover, rich biodiversity, and numerous water bodies. The low level of industrialisation and the relatively poor infrastructure base acts as an impediment to the exploitation of these natural resources in the interest of the state's economy.

The assessed generation capacity exceeds 3000 MW. The current installed capacity in the state is 185 MW, but the state itself consumes 610 MW. In other words, it imports electricity. The economic growth of the state suggests rising demand for electricity. The state has the potential to export net hydroelectric-generated electricity and earn income for its internal development plans. The state also has large deposits of coal, thus being a candidate for thermal power plants.\nSeveral projects are under works. The proposed Garo Hills thermal project at Nangalbibra is expected to generate an additional 751 MW of power. There is a proposal for setting up a 250 MW thermal power plant in West Khasi Hills. The State Government aims to increase its power generation output by about 2000-2500 MW, of which 700-980 MW will be thermal based while 1400-1520 MW will be hydroelectricity. The State Government has outlined a cost-shared public-private partnership model to accelerate private sector investments in its power sector. The generation transmission, transformation and distribution of electricity is entrusted to the Meghalaya Energy Corporation Limited which was constituted under the Electricity Supply Act, 1948. At present, there are five hydel power stations and one mini hydel including Umiam Hydel Project, Umtrew Hydel Project, Myntdu-Leshka-I Hydel Project, and the Sunapani Micro Hydel (SESU) Project.\nFor the 12th five-year plan of India, there is a proposal to set up more hydel power projects in the state: Kynshi (450 MW), Umngi \u22121 (54 MW), Umiam-Umtru -V (36 MW), Ganol (25 MW), Mawphu (120 MW), Nongkolait (120 MW), Nongnaw (50 MW), Rangmaw (65 MW), Umngot (260 MW), Umduna (57 MW), Myntdu-Leshka-II (60 MW), Selim (170 MW) and Mawblei (140 MW). Of these, Jaypee Group has committed itself to building the Kynshi and Umngot projects in Khasi hills.\n\n\n=== Education infrastructure ===\n\nMeghalaya had a literacy rate of 62.56 as per the 2001 census and is the 27th most literate state in India. This increased to 75.5 in 2011. As of 2006, the state had 5851 primary schools, 1759 middle schools, and 655 higher secondary schools respectively. In 2008, 518,000 students were enrolled in its primary schools, and 232,000 in upper primary schools. The state monitors its school for quality, access, infrastructure and teachers training.Institution for higher studies like Indian Institute of Management, the University of Technology and Management (USTM) which is in Shillong is the first Indian university to introduce cloud computing engineering as a field of study, in collaboration with IBM and the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies.

The youngest daughter inherits all the property and she is the caretaker of aged parents and any unmarried siblings. In some cases, such as when there is no daughter in the family or other reasons, the parents may nominate another girl such as a daughter in law as the heir of the house and all other property they may own.\nThe Khasi and Jaintia tribesmen follow the traditional matrilineal norm, wherein the Khun Khatduh (or the youngest daughter) inherits all the property and responsibilities for the family. The male line, particularly the mother's brother, may indirectly control the ancestral property since he may be involved in important decisions relating to property including its sale and disposal. In case a family has no daughters, the Khasi and Jaintia (also called Syntengs) have the custom of ia rap iing, where the family adopts a girl from another family, perform religious ceremonies with the community, and she then becomes ka trai iing (head of the house).In the Garo lineage system, the youngest daughter inherits the family property by default, unless another daughter is so named by the parents. She then becomes designated as nokna meaning 'for the house or home'. If there are no daughters, a chosen daughter-in-law (bohari) or an adopted child (deragata) comes to stay in the house and inherit the property.

These organisations include a wide spectrum of non-government organisations (NGOs), other community associations, and foundations. The current status of Meghalaya's civil society and the effectiveness of the many programs is debated by scholars.\nThere are currently over 181 NGOs within Meghalaya that vary from charities to volunteer services and social empowerment groups. Most civil society organisations are also ethnically affiliated as the interests of different groups are championed between each organisation . This in turn causes them to become representatives of ethnic communities around the state since the same individuals from such communities also participate in corresponding organisations that protect their ethnic interests. Three student organisations that represent the major ethnic groups of Meghalaya: Khasi Students' Union (KSU), Jantia Students' Union (JSU), and Garo Students' Union (GSU) embody this example into their overall functions as CSOs by applying pressure to local government in order to ensure that certain rights are being met.There also exists many forms of community associations that revolve around the idea of community building. This includes examples such as sports, religious, educational, and other clubs that aim to establish individuals into different social circles based on their interests.Philanthropic foundations in Meghalaya's civil society strive for the overall well-being of its citizens. The Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) has recently partnered with the government of Meghalaya to improve public health in many rural parts of the state by first strengthening the abilities of non-government organisations to perform such services.Scholars are divided on the effectiveness Meghalaya's civil society. Some argue for its important role in state development through CSOs, while others point out that their impact is not only limited from above by the central government and its military, but also from below by insurgent groups .Concerns over national security, such as the unification of neighbouring hostile countries and local insurgent groups for a possible attack on the Indian state, has served as the longstanding point of emphasis on how the Indian Central Government operates in the Northeast. Different administrative programs have been created to establish peace and stability in this region through economic development. The Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) that was passed in 1958 by the Indian Government granted the Indian Army exclusive powers to maintain order in this area. Many insurgent organisations were also developed alongside cultural and political movements, making it very difficult to distinguish them from what constitutes a civil society. These two factors have combined to enable CSOs to be easily deemed as insurgencies and grouped with other insurgent organisations that were banned by the government, thus restricting Meghalaya's civil society as a whole.", "start_char_idx": 34866, "end_char_idx": 38039, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd665a78-aa52-44fd-a6d6-20245f44b0f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd665a78-aa52-44fd-a6d6-20245f44b0f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5fd34641-7f78-467f-ad9c-98bfaf757e17", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "f0e0db0b595f3f106903c1897db9ab138221c888cb5cb0015af6c1335357b97e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f32f90d1-9629-46c1-891a-d13be019a170", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "fb0752a2b94797a6115342338cc44c27c2adfb0f60a2ff232c4efca9cc326453", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dce8f57c-cf1c-493d-8f0f-801bd7ac54ee", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "eaa42a92160a5b65a998905fdc91130c8cd6f50c81811d057945f99b3544f93c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Traditional political institutions ===\nAll the three major ethnic tribal groups, namely, the Khasis, Jaintias and the Garos also have their own traditional political institutions that have existed for hundreds of years. These political institutions were fairly well developed and functioned at various tiers, such as the village level, clan level, and state level.In the traditional political system of the Khasis, each clan has its own council known as the Dorbar Kur which is presided over by the clan headman. The council or the Dorbar managed the internal affairs of the clan. Similarly, every village has a local assembly known as the Dorbar Shnong, i.e. village Durbar or council, which is presided over by the village headman. The inter-village issues were dealt with through a political unit comprising adjacent Khasi Villages. The local political units are known as the raids, under by the supreme political authority is known as the Syiemship. The Syiemship is the congregation of several raids and is headed an elected chief known as the Syiem or Siem (the king). The Siem rules the Khasi state through an elected State Assembly, known as the Durbar Hima. The Siem also has his mantris (ministers) whose counsel he would use in exercising executive responsibilities. Taxes were called pynsuk, and tolls were called khrong, the latter being the primary source of state income. In the early 20th century, Raja Dakhor Singh was the Siem of Khymir.\nThe Jaintias also have a three-tier political system somewhat similar to the Khasis, including the Raids and the Syiem. The raids are headed by Dolois, who are responsible for performing the executive and ceremonial functions at the Raid level. At the lowest level are the village headmen. Each administrative tier has its own elected councils or durbars.\nIn the traditional political system of the Garos, a group of Garo villages form the A\u00b7king. The A\u00b7king functions under the supervision of the Nokmas, which is perhaps the only political and administrative authority in the political institution of the Garos. The Nokma performs both judicial and legislative functions. The Nokmas also congregates to address inter-A\u00b7king issues.

Here, functional, living, architecture is created by slowly training the aerial roots of the Ficus elastica (rubber tree). Examples of these structures can be found as far west as the valley east of Mawsynram, and as far east as the East Jaintia Hills District, meaning that they are made by both Khasis and Jaintias. Large numbers of these man-made living structures exist in the mountainous terrain along the southern border of the Shillong Plateau, though as a cultural practice they are fading, with many individual examples having disappeared recently, either falling in landslides or floods or being replaced with more standard steel bridges.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nThe partition of the country in 1947 created severe infrastructural constraints for the Northeastern region, with merely 2% of the perimeter of the region adjoining the rest of the country. A narrow strip of land often called the Siliguri Corridor or the Chicken's Neck, connects the region with the state of West Bengal. Meghalaya is a landlocked state with many small settlements in remote areas. The road is the only means of transport. While the capital Shillong is relatively well connected, road connectivity in most other parts is relatively poor. A significant portion of the roads in the state is still unpaved. Most of the arrivals into the Meghalaya take place through Guwahati in neighbouring Assam, which is nearly 103 km away. Assam has a major railhead as well as an airport with regular train and air services to the rest of the country.\nWhen Meghalaya was carved out of Assam as an autonomous state in 1972, it inherited a total road length of 2786.68 km including 174 km of National Highways with road density of 12.42 km per 100 square kilometre. By 2004, total road length has reached up to 9,350 km out of which 5,857 km were surfaced. The road density had increased to 41.69 km per 100 square kilometre by March 2011. Meghalaya is far below the national average of 75 km per 100 km2. To provide better services to the people of the state, the Meghalaya Public Works Department is taking steps for improvement and up-gradation of the existing roads and bridges in phased manner.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Road network ===\nMeghalaya has a road network of around 7,633 km, out of which 3,691 km is black-topped and the remaining 3942 km is gravelled. Meghalaya is also connected to Silchar in Assam, Aizawl in Mizoram, and Agartala in Tripura through national highways.

The Cherra Companyganj State Railways was a former mountain railway through the state. Guwahati (103 kilometres (64 mi) from Shillong) is the nearest major railway station connecting the north-east region with the rest of the country through a broad gauge track network. There is a plan for extending the rail link from Guwahati to Byrnihat (20 kilometres (12 mi) from Guwahati) within Meghalaya and further extending it up to state capital Shillong.\n\n\n=== Aviation ===\nState capital Shillong has an airport at Umroi 30 kilometres (19 mi) from Shillong on the Guwahati-Shillong highway. A new terminal building was built at a cost of \u20b930 crore (US$3.8 million) and inaugurated in June 2011. Air India Regional operates flights to Kolkata from this airport. There is also a helicopter service connecting Shillong to Guwahati and Tura. Baljek Airport near Tura became operational in 2008. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) is developing the airport for operation of ATR 42/ATR 72 type of aircraft. Other nearby airports are in Assam, with Borjhar, Guwahati airport (IATA: GAU), about 124 kilometres (77 mi) from Shillong.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nUntil 1955, foreign tourists required special permits to enter the areas that now constitute the state of Meghalaya, which are sometimes compared to Scotland for their highlands, fog and scenery. Meghalaya has some of the thickest primary forests in the country and therefore constitutes one of the most important ecotourism circuits in India. The Meghalaya subtropical forests support a vast variety of flora and fauna. The state has two national parks and three wildlife sanctuaries.\nMeghalaya also offers many adventure tourism opportunities in the form of mountaineering, rock climbing, trekking, and hiking, caving (spelunking) and water sports. The state offers several trekking routes, some of which also afford an opportunity to encounter rare animals. The Umiam Lake has a water sports complex with facilities such as rowboats, paddleboats, sailing boats, cruise-boats, water-scooters, and speedboats.\nCherrapunji is a tourist destination in north-east of India. It lies to the south of the capital Shillong. A rather scenic 50-kilometre long road connects Cherrapunji with Shillong.\nLiving root bridges are also a tourist draw, with many examples located near Cherrapunji. The Double-Decker root bridge, along with several others, is found in the village of Nongriat, which is tourist friendly. Many other root bridges can be found nearby, in the villages of Nongthymmai, Mynteng, and Tynrong. Other areas with root bridges include Riwai village, near the tourist village of Mawlynnong, Pynursla, especially the villages of Rangthyllaing and Mawkyrnot, and the area around Dawki, in the West Jaintia Hills district, where there are many living root bridges scattered throughout the nearby villages.\nWaterfalls and rivers\nThe most visited waterfalls in the state include the Elephant Falls, Shadthum Falls, Weinia falls, Bishop Falls, Nohkalikai Falls, Langshiang Falls and Sweet Falls.", "start_char_idx": 45728, "end_char_idx": 48938, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c54a523d-c517-4352-9ca3-675f3495430d": {"__data__": {"id_": "c54a523d-c517-4352-9ca3-675f3495430d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5fd34641-7f78-467f-ad9c-98bfaf757e17", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "f0e0db0b595f3f106903c1897db9ab138221c888cb5cb0015af6c1335357b97e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ea75dbd6-d408-44a5-9a1a-ff8143426ea7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "5303f3676a4c581adb51677a6ba5a89e05fa8c6fdb78bb8a1478c5500a693289", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f4263d65-ad4f-449d-9829-5c509ccba06b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "64438f2eaac980fe8136f757bf66fc60c11a5610cfcd88837cf0f468de70a4f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Waterfalls and rivers\nThe most visited waterfalls in the state include the Elephant Falls, Shadthum Falls, Weinia falls, Bishop Falls, Nohkalikai Falls, Langshiang Falls and Sweet Falls.

It is 14 kilometres from Nongstoin. The island is formed by the bifurcation of Kynshi River into the Phanliang River and the Namliang River. Adjacent to the sandy beach the Phanliang River forms a lake. The river then moves along and before reaching a deep gorge, forms a waterfall about 60 meters high called Shadthum Fall.\n\nSacred grovesMeghalaya is also known for its \"sacred groves\". They are small or large areas of forests or natural vegetation that are usually dedicated to local folk deities or tree spirits or some religious symbolism over many generations, often since ancient times. These spaces are found all over India, are protected by local communities, and in some cases, the locals would neither touch leaves or fruits or in other ways damage the forest, flora or fauna taking refuge in them. This guardianship creates a sacred area where nature and wildlife thrive. The Mawphlang sacred forest, also known as \"Law Lyngdoh,\" is one of the most famous sacred forests in Meghalaya. It's located about 25 kilometres from Shillong. It's a scenic nature destination, and one can find the sacred Rudraksha tree here.\nRural areasMeghalaya rural life and villages offer a glimpse in northeast mountain life. The Mawlynnong village located near the India-Bangladesh border is one such village. It has been featured by travel magazine Discover India. The village is geared for tourism and has a Living Root Bridges, hiking trails and rock formations.\n\nLakesMeghalaya also has many natural and manmade lakes. The Umiam Lake (popularly known as Bara Pani meaning Big water) on the Guwahati-Shillong road is a major tourism attraction for tourist. Meghalaya has several parks; Thangkharang Park, the Eco-park, the Botanical Garden and Lady Hydari Park to name a few. Dawki, which is located at about 96 Kilometres from Shillong is the gateway to Bangladesh and affords a scenic view of some of the tallest mountain ranges in Meghalaya and the Bangladesh borderlands.\nThadlaskein Lake also Pung Sajar Nangli is the only historical Lake of Meghalaya. It is located besides National Highway 6 by the side of a small village called Mukhla village which falls under West Jaintia Hills district Jowai.

Efforts are underway to fence it completely and introduce means to issue ID cards.Chief Minister Mukul Sangma, in August 2012, called upon Government of India to take corrective measures to stop the illegal immigration of Bangladeshis into the northeast of the country before the situation goes out of hand.\n\n\n=== Violence ===\nBetween 2006 and 2013, between 0 and 28 civilians have died per year in Meghalaya (or about 0 to 1 per 100,000 people), which the state authorities have classified as terror-related intentional violence. The world's average annual death rate from intentional violence, in recent years, has been 7.9 per 100,000 people. The terror-related deaths are from conflicts primarily between different tribal groups and against migrants from Bangladesh. Along with political resolution and dialogue, various Christian organisations have taken the initiative to prevent violence and help the process of discussion between groups.There have been repeated clashes with Assam e.g. Mukroh.\n\n\n=== Political instability ===\nThe state has had 23 state governments since its inception in 1972, with a median life span of less than 18 months. Only three governments have survived more than three years. Political instability has affected the state's economy in the past. Over recent years, there has been increasing political stability. The last state assembly elections were held in 2013, after a five-year government that was elected in 2008.\n\n\n=== Jhum farming ===\nJhum farming, or cut-and-burn shift cultivation, is an ancient practice in Meghalaya. It is culturally engrained through folklores. One legend states the god of wind with the god of hail and storm shook off seeds from the celestial tree, which were picked up and sown by a bird known as do' amik. These were the seeds of rice. The god gave the human beings some of those celestial seeds, provided instruction on shift agriculture and proper rice cultivation practice, with the demand that at every harvest a portion of the first harvest must be dedicated to him. Another folktale is from the Garo Hills of Meghalaya where a man named Bone-Neripa-Jane-Nitepa harvested rice and millet from a patch of land he cleared and cultivated near the rock named misi-Kokdok. He then shared this knowledge with others, and named the different months of the year, each of which is a stage of shifting cultivation.In modern times, shift cultivation is a significant threat to the biodiversity of Meghalaya. A 2001 satellite imaging study showed that shift cultivation practice continues and patches of primary dense forests are lost even from areas protected as biosphere. Jhum farming is a threat not only for natural biodiversity, it is also a low yield unproductive method of agriculture. It is a significant issue in Meghalaya, given majority of its people rely on agriculture to make a living. Shift farming is a practice that is not unique to northeastern Indian states such as Meghalaya, but the issue is found throughout southeast Asia.", "start_char_idx": 54278, "end_char_idx": 58082, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57c3a369-37a8-4185-864d-5d4662807d34": {"__data__": {"id_": "57c3a369-37a8-4185-864d-5d4662807d34", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5fd34641-7f78-467f-ad9c-98bfaf757e17", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "f0e0db0b595f3f106903c1897db9ab138221c888cb5cb0015af6c1335357b97e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c180846c-be53-46c4-9656-2bc44a6fbba9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Meghalaya.txt", "file_name": "Meghalaya.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 59660, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "ac8d241c03b983417df5e16f04bc1c96909aab5a6319819d0444c63adb430651", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6119b977-cfd9-47ca-ab36-b598a6552ba4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "207a8a84bada5087c3863262c3e99b878be47429615116a7faf896e2f6fbe753", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Media ==\nSome major media outlets in the state are:\nMeghalaya Times: Meghalaya Times is one of the new entrants in the market and the fastest growing English newspaper in the state.

The name of the state is derived from \"Mizo\", the endonym of the native inhabitants, and \"Ram\", which in the Mizo language means \"land.\" Thus \"Mizo-ram\" means \"land of the Mizos\". Within India's northeast region, it is the southernmost landlocked state, sharing borders with three of the Seven Sister States, namely Tripura, Assam and Manipur. The state also shares a 722-kilometre (449 mi) border with the neighbouring countries of Bangladesh and Myanmar.Like several other northeastern states of India, Mizoram was previously part of Assam until 1972, when it was carved out as a Union Territory. In 1986, the Indian Parliament adopted the 53rd amendment of the Indian Constitution, which allowed for the creation of the State of Mizoram on 20 February 1987, as India's 23rd state.\nAccording to a 2011 census, in that year Mizoram's population was 1,091,014. It is the 2nd least populous state in the country (after Sikkim, with population of 610,577 in 2011). Mizoram spans over an area of approximately 21,087 square kilometres, of which approximately 91% is forested.About 95% of Mizoram's population descends from a diverse tribal origin. Mizos first began to settle the area in the 16th century, coming in waves of immigration from Southeast Asia. This immigration lasted through the 18th century. Among all of the states of India, Mizoram has the highest concentration of tribal people. The Mizoram people are currently protected under the Indian constitution as a Scheduled Tribe. Mizoram is one of three states of India with a Christian majority (87%).Mizoram is a highly literate agrarian economy. Slash-and-burn farming, also known as jhum, is the most common form of farming in the state. In recent years, the jhum farming practices have been steadily replaced with a significant horticulture and bamboo products industry. The state's gross state domestic product for 2012 was estimated at \u20b969.91 billion (US$880 million). About 20% of Mizoram's population lives below the poverty line, with 35% rural poverty as of 2014. The state has about 871 kilometres of national highways, with NH\u201354 and NH\u2013150 connecting it to Assam and Manipur respectively. It is also a growing transit point for trade with Myanmar and Bangladesh.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe term Mizoram is derived from two Mizo words-Mizo and ram. 'Mizo' is the name used to call the native inhabitants and 'Ram' means 'land'. There is a dispute on the term 'zo'. According to one view, 'zo' means 'highland' (or hill) and Mizoram means 'land of the Mizos'. B. Lalthangliana says 'zo' may also mean 'cold region' and therefore, Mizo may also signify people of the cold region.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2754, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa035c50-092c-43ee-805d-85e13d3f92c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa035c50-092c-43ee-805d-85e13d3f92c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6617cfc7-9634-40f9-91a3-33de0009c3d7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "cb542b7bd0b06eb13d6219d6432eeadf5267896c28565e9b72c61de7121d364d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6119b977-cfd9-47ca-ab36-b598a6552ba4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "081c69d0ab7e9052f01d1f59265be6038fa1a13f7799571ee5360163113afe96", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c7bab5cb-b4ea-45bb-be08-5372e97debfa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "df7eeefe6ac814374c2017a576f7f322ae674395ff61ec3ebc7969edc36a7784", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== History ==\n\nThe origin of the Mizos, like those of many other tribes in the northeastern India, is shrouded in mystery. The people living in the Mizo Hills were generally referred to as the Cucis or Kukis by their neighbouring ethnic groups which was also a term adopted by the British writers. The claim that 'The Kukis are the earliest known residents of the Mizo hills area,' must be read in this light. The majority of the tribes classified as \"Mizo\" today most likely migrated to their present territories from the neighbouring countries in several waves, starting around 1500 CE.Before the British Raj, the various Mizo clans lived in autonomous villages. The tribal chiefs enjoyed an eminent position in the gerontocratic Mizo society. The various clans and subclans practised slash-and-burn, locally called jhum cultivation - a form of subsistence agriculture. The chiefs were the absolute rulers of their respective clans' territories (ram), although they remained under the nominal political jurisdictions of the rulers of Manipur, Tripura and Burma.Prior to 1895, the year that the British Raj gained political control over Mizoram, there were many reports of head-hunting in the Mizoram area via tribal raids led by the village chieftains. Head-hunting was a practice which often involved the ambushing of a rival tribe, the taking of slaves and the cutting off of the heads of the defenders. These heads would sometimes be displayed at the entrances to the tribal village of the victors.\n\n\n=== British era (1840s to 1940s) ===\n\nSome of the earliest records of raids and intertribal conflicts are from the early 19th century. In the 1840s, Captain Blackwood of Britain marched into the Mizo Hills with his troops to punish a Palian tribal chief for raiding British interests in India. A few years later, Captain Lester was wounded in a battle with the Lusei tribe in the region that is now Mizoram. In 1849, a Lusei tribal raid killed 29 members of the Thadou tribe and added 42 captives to their clan. Colonel Lister retaliated in 1850, with the co-operation of the Thadou tribe, an event historically called the First British invasion, burning down a Lusei village of 800 tribal houses and freeing 400 Thadou captives. British historical records on the Mizo Hills state that similar inter-ethnic tribal raids continued for decades after the First British Invasion. Such raids would be for the purpose of seeking out loot, slaves or retaliation for earlier lost battles.The Mizo Hills formally became part of British India in 1895, and practices such as head-hunting were banned in Mizoram as well as neighbouring regions. The northern and southern Mizo Hills became the Lushai Hills, with Aizawl as their headquarters by declaring the whole area as an \"excluded area\" till India got independence from the British. At the time of the British conquest, there were around 60 chiefs.", "start_char_idx": 2757, "end_char_idx": 5653, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7bab5cb-b4ea-45bb-be08-5372e97debfa": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7bab5cb-b4ea-45bb-be08-5372e97debfa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6617cfc7-9634-40f9-91a3-33de0009c3d7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "cb542b7bd0b06eb13d6219d6432eeadf5267896c28565e9b72c61de7121d364d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "aa035c50-092c-43ee-805d-85e13d3f92c8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "8aef6e77e30a33a6d0cad3ef484508580230f430a3760b0e856385c849dcb73a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0c9e1106-6d32-4da0-9522-5b341f4d6b85", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "831b592fe53d115fff2f5ee40b3015f0fd0f62d498008f70ad91fc834644c449", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Post 1947 ===\n\nBy the time India gained independence from the British Empire, the number of tribal chiefs had increased to over 200. The educated elites among the Mizos campaigned against the tribal chiefdoms under the banner of the Mizo Union. As a result of their campaign, the hereditary rights of the 259 chiefs were abolished under the Assam-Lushai District (\"Acquisition of Chief's Rights\") Act, 1954. Village courts were re-implemented in the Mizo region along with other parts of Assam. Few Christian missionaries came to Mizoram during the colonial period knowing that the rural hill population was busy fighting among different tribes. The missionaries propagated Christianity with the support of the British government. As a result, majority of the population converted to Christianity and changed their faiths without any resistance. The Mizos were particularly dissatisfied with the government's inadequate response to the 1959\u201360 mautam famine. The Mizo National Famine Front, a body formed for famine relief in 1959, later developed into a new political organisation, the Mizo National Front (MNF) in 1961. A period of protests and armed insurgency followed in the 1960s, which resulted in the MNF seeking independence from India.\n\nIn 1971, the government agreed to convert Mizo District into a Union Territory, which became Mizoram in 1972.

Slash-and-burn or jhum cultivation, though discouraged, remains in practice in Mizoram and affects its topography. A report by Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in 2021 states that Mizoram has the highest forest cover as a percentage of its geographical area of any Indian state, being 84.53% forest.\n\nMizoram terrain is, according to the Geological Survey of India, an immature topography, and the physiographic expression consists of several almost north\u2013south longitudinal valleys containing series of small and flat hummocks, mostly anticlinal, parallel to sub-parallel hill ranges and narrow adjoining synclinal valleys with series of topographic highs. The general geology of western Mizoram consists of repetitive succession of Neogene sedimentary rocks of the Surma Group and Tipam Formation such as sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and rare pockets of shell limestone. The eastern part is the Barail Group. Mizoram lies in seismic zone V, according to the India Meteorological Department; as with other northeastern states of India, this means the state has the highest risk of earthquakes relative to other parts of India.The biggest river in Mizoram is Chhimtuipui, also known as Kaladan (or Kolodyne). It originates in Chin state in Burma and passes through Saiha and Lawngtlai districts in the southern tip of Mizoram, goes back to Burma's Rakhine state. Although many more rivers and streams drain the hill ranges, the most important and useful rivers are the Tlawng, Tut, Tuirial and Tuivawl which flow through the northern territory and eventually join the Barak River in Cachar District. The rivers have a gentle drainage gradient particularly in the south.", "start_char_idx": 7385, "end_char_idx": 10382, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "afa63b4e-0f53-4bda-a575-47fec3d5b1c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "afa63b4e-0f53-4bda-a575-47fec3d5b1c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6617cfc7-9634-40f9-91a3-33de0009c3d7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "cb542b7bd0b06eb13d6219d6432eeadf5267896c28565e9b72c61de7121d364d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0c9e1106-6d32-4da0-9522-5b341f4d6b85", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "f259fb2d6e3c07c32b79a9500b46d7081597f787edccd55a1f729d070c9223e6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3b7ce782-cd45-4dea-a356-31b65d607257", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5ff853f2e325232affc9960e15d59066ae91c8a892b178e02fbac531c781edb9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Climate ===\nMizoram has a mild climate, being relatively cool in summer 20 to 29 \u00b0C (68 to 84 \u00b0F) but progressively warmer, most probably due to climate change, with summer temperatures crossing 30 degrees Celsius and winter temperatures ranging from 7 to 22 \u00b0C (45 to 72 \u00b0F). The region is influenced by monsoons, raining heavily from May to September with little rain in the dry (cold) season. The climate pattern is moist tropical to moist sub-tropical, with average state rainfall 254 centimetres (100 in) per annum. In the capital Aizawl, rainfall is about 215 centimetres (85 in) and in Lunglei, another major centre, about 350 centimetres (140 in).

Tropical semi-evergreen, tropical moist deciduous, subtropical broadleaved hill and subtropical pine forests are the most common vegetation types found in Mizoram. Bamboo is common in the state, typically intermixed with other forest vegetation; about 9,245 km2 (44%) of the state's area is bamboo bearing. The state and central governments of India have cooperated to reserve and protect 67% of the land covered by forests, and additional 15% by management. Only 17% of the land is non-forested area for cultivation, industry, mining, housing and other commercial human activity. Satellite data suggests 91% of state's geographical area is covered by forests.Jhum cultivation, or slash-and-burn practice, was a historic tradition in Mizoram and a threat to its forest cover. This practice has reduced in recent decades, due to a government-supported initiative to support horticultural crops such as pineapple and banana plantations.\nMizoram is host to numerous species of birds, wildlife and flora.

This reflects a 22.8% growth since 2001 census; still, Mizoram is second least populated state of India. The sex ratio of the state is 976 females per thousand males, higher than the national ratio 940. The density of population is 52 persons per square kilometre.The literacy rate of Mizoram in 2011 was 91.58 per cent, higher than the national average 74.04 per cent, and second best among all the states of India. About 52% of Mizoram population lives in urban areas, much higher than India's average. Over one third of the population of Mizoram lives in Aizawl district, which hosts the capital.\n\n\n=== Largest cities or towns ===\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nThe great majority of Mizoram's population consists of several ethnic tribes who are either culturally or linguistically linked. These ethnic groups are collectively known as Mizos (Mi means People, Zo meaning the name of a progenitor; Mizo thus is People of Zo origin).\nSometime in the 16th century CE, the first batch of Mizo crossed Tiau River and settled in Mizoram and they were called as Kukis by Bengalis. The term Kuki mean the inhabitants of the interior and inaccessible mountain tracts. Sometimes grouped as Kuki-Chin tribes, The First batch were called Old Kukis, which are the Biate, Ranglong and the Hrangkhol, and the second batch that followed include Lushei (or Lusei), Paite, Lai, Mara, Ralte, Hmar, Thadou, Shendus, and several other.The Bru (Reang), Chakma, Tanchangya are some non-Kuki tribes of Mizoram, with some suggestion that some of these are Indo-Aryan in their origins. The Bnei Menashe tribe claim Jewish descent.The diversity of tribal groups reflects the historical immigration patterns. Different tribes and sub-tribes arrived in the present Mizoram, in successive waves and settled down in different parts of the state. Further, as they arrived, there were raids, fear of raids and intertribal feuds. The resulting isolation and separation created numerous tribes and sub-tribes.Other than tribal groups, other ethnic groups inhabit Mizoram including Bengalis and Nepalis. Nepali Gorkhas, for example, were encouraged to settle in Aizawl area and other parts of Mizoram during the British colonial times. Thousands of their descendants are now residents of Mizoram.\n\n\n=== Protected demographic category ===\nAccording to 2011 census, Mizoram had 1,036,115 people (nearly 95% of total) classified as Scheduled Tribe, the highest concentration of protected tribal people in all states of India. This demographic classification, given to Mizoram tribes since the 1950s, has provided reservations and extra resources in education and government job opportunities, a preferential treatment as a means to accelerate their integration with mainstream society.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nMizo and English are the official languages of the state.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe majority (87%) of Mizos are Christians in various denominations, predominantly Presbyterian. Mizoram has a significant Theravada Buddhist population of 8.5%, who are mainly Chakma people, making them the largest religious minority in the region, followed by Hindus at 2.7% according to the 2011 census.

The institution of chieftainship began in the 16th century. Each village behaved like a small state, and the chief was called Lal. The rule was hereditary, and there were no written laws (the first script for Mizo language was developed by Christian Missionaries Lorraine and Savidge about 1895).After annexation by the British in the 1890s, the northern part of Mizoram was administered as the Lushai Hills district of Assam, while southern Mizoram was part of Bengal. In 1898, the southern part was transferred from Bengal to Assam. The colonial power retained the chiefs and Mizo customs, including the socially stratified hereditary transfer of political power. In 1937, under Section 6 of the Scheduled District Act, the British administration consolidated executive and legislative political power to the Deputy Commissioner and District magistrates, with village chiefs in advisory role. The political and judiciary powers of chiefs were neither final nor exclusive, thereafter. Rulings could be appealed to courts staffed with British officials. After India gained independence from the colonial rule, the region was granted autonomous status in 1952, where Mizo people formulated their own laws and delivered judicial decisions. The region was renamed as Mizo District within Assam State in April 1954 and in that year, the institution of hereditary chieftainship was abolished, and instead village courts/council were set up.The representatives of the Lushai Hills Autonomous District Council and the Mizo Union pleaded with the States Reorganisation Commission (SRC) to integrate the Mizo-dominated areas of Tripura and Manipur with the District Council in Assam. The tribal leaders in the northeast were unhappy with the final SRC recommendations and met in Aizawl in 1955 to form a new political party, Eastern India Tribal Union (EITU).\nIn the 1950s, the fears of Assamese hegemony and perceived lack of government concern led to growing discontent among the Mizos. The Mizos were particularly dissatisfied with the government's inadequate response to the 1959\u201360 mautam famine. The Mizo National Famine Front, a body formed for famine relief in 1959, later developed into a new political organisation, the Mizo National Front (MNF) in 1961. The Front sought sovereign independence for the Mizo territory, staging an armed insurrection with the 28 February 1966 uprising against the government. The revolt was suppressed by the government of India, which carried out airstrikes in Aizawl and surrounding areas.Assam state was split, re-organised into multiple political regions, Mizo hills area was declared Mizoram after the insurgency, and it received status as a Union Territory in 1972. A Peace Accord was signed between central government and insurgent groups of Mizoram on 30 June 1986. Per the accord, insurgents surrendered their arms and Mizoram became the 23rd state of India in 1986, formalised the following year. The first election of Mizoram Legislative Assembly was held on 16 February 1987. Elections have been held at 5-year intervals since then. Elections were held for 40 seats of legislative assembly on 28 November 2018. The voter turnout was 80%. The Mizo National Front led by Zoramthanga was elected to power.Kambhampati Hari Babu is the governor of Mizoram since July 2021.", "start_char_idx": 19323, "end_char_idx": 22734, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55a9b596-a656-4977-918a-0a34f302cfb5": {"__data__": {"id_": "55a9b596-a656-4977-918a-0a34f302cfb5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6617cfc7-9634-40f9-91a3-33de0009c3d7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "cb542b7bd0b06eb13d6219d6432eeadf5267896c28565e9b72c61de7121d364d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a357c765-e8ad-4685-87c0-5fa0b5bdda4e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "5568478ffef208fa3a068c671959613778990997235b8b010ef77064e3e5c0a4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3c091512-863c-4186-a30e-601da6575871", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "624fcf9808c11b7fa8a67c51606535e992c31e631fadd688147a1a3fc706556d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Administration ==\n\nThe Mizoram State Legislative Assembly has 40 seats and the Village Councils are the grassroots of democracy and leadership in Mizoram.

The state's gross state domestic product (GSDP) growth rate was nearly 10% annually over 2001-2013 period. As of 2019, the state's GSDP was US$ 3.57 billion. With international borders with Bangladesh and Myanmar, it is an important port state for southeast Asian imports to India, as well as exports from India.The biggest contributors to state's GSDP growth are Agriculture, Public Administration and Construction work. Tertiary sector of service sector continued to have the contribution to the GSDP with its share hovering between 58 per cent and 60 per cent during the past decade.As of 2013, according to the Reserve Bank of India, 20.4% of total state population is below poverty line, about same as the 21.9% average for India.

The sector's contribution to the gross state domestic product was 30% in 1994, just 14% in 2009 due to economic growth of other sectors.Agriculture has traditionally been a subsistence profession in Mizoram. It is seen as a means for generate food for one's family, ignoring its potential for commerce, growth and prosperity. Rice remains the largest crop grown in Mizoram by gross value of output. Fruits have grown to become the second largest category, followed by condiments and spices.\nJhum practiceBefore 1947, agriculture in Mizoram predominantly used to be slash-and-burn driven Jhum cultivation. This was discouraged by the state government, and the practice has been slowly declining. A 2012 report estimates the proportion of shifting cultivation area in Mizoram to be about 30% - predominant part of which was for rice production (56% to 63% depending on the year). Despite dedicating largest amount of labour, jhum cultivated and non-jhum crop area to rice, the yields are low; Mizoram average rice yields per acre is about 70% of India's average rice yield per acre and 32% of India's best yield. Mizoram produces about 26% of rice it consumes every year, and it buys the deficit from other states of India.The crop area used for jhum cultivation rotates in Mizoram; that is, the area slashed and burnt for a crop is abandoned for a few years and then jhumias return to slash and burn the same plot after a few years of non-use. The primary reasons for cyclical jhum cultivation includes, according to Goswami et al.\nHorticultureIn horticulture and floriculture, Mizoram is a significant producer and global exporter of Anthurium (over 7 million a year) and roses. It is also a significant producer and domestic supplier of banana, ginger, turmeric, passion fruit, orange and chowchow. Mizoram has accomplished this horticulture success and exports in 2009, with just 6% of its cultivated land dedicated to horticulture and floriculture, indicating a large potential for further growth and economic integration with other Indian states as well export driven economy. In 2013, the area dedicated to horticulture and floriculture increased to 9.4% of 1.2 million hectares potential.The agricultural productivity is very low in Mizoram. The state gets a lot of rain, but its soil is porous and irrigation infrastructure very inadequate; this has affected it crop yield and reliability. The yield issue that can be addressed by building irrigation infrastructure and adoption of better crop technologies. The state also has very low consumption of fertiliser and pesticides, which scholars suggest offers an opportunity for organic farming particularly of vegetables and fruits.\n\n\n=== Forestry, fisheries and sericulture ===\nMizoram is one of the leading producers of bamboo in India, has 27 species of bamboo, and supplies 14% of India's commercial bamboo. Forest products contribute about 5% to the state's gross product. The state produces about 5,200 metric tonnes of fish a year, about 12% of potential that can be sustainably achieved. Sericulture is an important handicraft industry engaged by nearly 8,000 families in over 300 Mizo villages.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\nMizoram has two industrial estates at Zuangtui and Kolasib.

Another software technology park is being established in Mizoram University campus. The state government has acquired 127 acres of land in Khawnuam for development of the Indo-Myanmar border trade township.\n\n\n=== Education infrastructure ===\n\nThe first primary school was set up in 1898 at Aizawl by Christian missionaries. The state has long enjoyed higher literacy rates than average literacy rates for India. In 1961, the literacy was 51%. By 2011 census, it had reached 92%, compared to 74% average for India. Mizoram is second only to Kerala.There were 3,894 schools in Mizoram as of 2012. Of these, 42% are publicly owned and managed by Central/State governments, 28% are private without government subsidies, 21% are private with government subsidies, and the rest are primary and middle schools that are government financed by run by three Autonomous District Councils of Mizoram. The teacher-pupil ratio is about 1:20 for primary, 1:9 for middle School, 1:13 for high, and 1:15 for higher secondary schools.There are several educational establishments under the umbrella of the Ministry of Education, including universities, colleges and other institutions. Within Mizoram University, there are 29 undergraduate departments including 2 professional institutions affiliated with the university. The state had 22 other colleges, and the total college enrolment was approximately 10,600 students in 2012. Other well known institutes are National Institute of Technology Mizoram, ICFAI University, Mizoram, College of Veterinary Sciences & Animal Husbandry, Selesih, Aizawl, Mizoram and Regional Institute of Paramedical and Nursing Aizawl.\n\n\n=== Energy infrastructure ===\nMizoram is not self-sufficient in power. In 2012, the state had a demand for 107 MW of power, but had an effective installed capacity of only 29.35 MW. To bridge the gap, it purchased electricity from the national grid.The hydroelectric power potential of Mizoram was assessed to be about 3600 MW in 2010, and about 4500 MW in 2012. If even half of this is realised, the state could supply all its citizens and industry with 24/7 electricity, as well as earn income by selling surplus power to the national grid. The topography of Mizoram hydroelectric resources is ideal for power projects. The following rivers are suited for hydel projects with minimal impact on its biosphere \u2013 Tuivai, Tuivawl, Tlawng, Tut, Serlui, Tuirial, Kolodyne, Tuichang, Tuipui, Tiau and Mat. Beyond the major rivers, Mizoram has many small but perennial streams and rivulets with ideal condition for developing micro/mini and small hydroelectric projects. The state has proposed projects to attract private investments on Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (BOOT) basis with financial assistance in rehabilitating its citizens were they to be affected by the project. The largest proposed project is expected to be on Kolodyne (460 MW), and there are dozens of small to micro projects that have been identified.The main energy infrastructures in Mizoram are:\n\nTuirial Dam 60 MW.\nSerlui B Dam 12 MW.\nVankal Solar Park 20 MW.", "start_char_idx": 28680, "end_char_idx": 31835, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d91fa43-1f2d-415f-8142-c6bad249e8f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "2d91fa43-1f2d-415f-8142-c6bad249e8f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6617cfc7-9634-40f9-91a3-33de0009c3d7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "cb542b7bd0b06eb13d6219d6432eeadf5267896c28565e9b72c61de7121d364d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d62f1bcf-c75f-4313-85d5-992f1f3c77a8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "4c00e990f8830c739e0f7e098c981dc1543952aea1cb8b70a4ebba5a00d30575", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ad74473f-c7db-476f-8013-ea816b838dd4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6a56a34fcf4b7244b55959897d09243915590e6901e8f344060b119f9b18ebe4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Transport infrastructure ==\nRoad Network: In 2012, Mizoram had a road network of around 8,500 kilometres (5,300 mi) including unsurfaced village roads to surfaced national highways; and there were 106,000 registered motor vehicles. The village roads are primarily single lane or unmetalled tracks that are typically lightly trafficked. Mizoram had 871 kilometres of national highways, 1,663 kilometres of state highways and 2,320 kilometres of surfaced district roads. All of Mizoram's 23 urban centres and 59% of its 764 villages are connected by all weather roads. However, landslide and weather damage to these roads is significant in parts.Airport: Mizoram has an airport, Lengpui Airport (IATA: AJL), near Aizawl and its runway is 3,130 feet long at an elevation of 1,000 feet.Helicopter: A Helicopter service by Pawan Hans has been started which connects the Aizawl with Lunglei, Lawngtlai, Saiha, Chawngte, Serchhip, Champhai, Kolasib, Khawzawl, Mamit and Hnahthial.\nWater Ways: Mizoram is in the process of developing water ways with the port of Akyab Sittwe in Burma along its biggest river, Chhimtuipui. It drains into Burma's Rakhine state, and finally enters the Bay of Bengal at Akyab, which is a popular port in Sittwe, Burma. The Indian government considers it a priority to set up inland water ways along this river to trade with Burma. The project is known as the Kaladan Multi-modal Transit Transport Project. India is investing $103 million to develop the Sittwe port on Burma's northern coast, about 160 kilometres (99 mi) from Mizoram. State Peace and Development Council of Burma has committed $10 million for the venture. The project is expected to be complete in 2015, and consists of two parts. First, river Kaladan (or Kolodyne, Chhimtuipui) is being dredged and widened from the port at Sittwe to Paletwa, in Chin province, adjacent to Mizoram. This 160 km inland waterway will enable cargo ships to enter, upload and offload freight in Paletwa, Myanmar; this is expected to be complete in 2014. As second part of the project, being constructed in parallel, includes a 62 km two-lane highway from Paletwa (also known as Kaletwa or Setpyitpyin) to Lomasu, Mizoram. Additionally, an all weather multilane 100 km road from Lomasu to Lawngtlai in Mizoram is being built to connect it with the Indian National Highway 54. This part of the project is slated to be complete by 2015. Once complete, this project is expected to economically benefit trade and horticulture exports of Mizoram, as well as improve economic access to 60 million people of landlocked northeast India and Myanmar.\n\n\n== Education ==", "start_char_idx": 31838, "end_char_idx": 34467, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad74473f-c7db-476f-8013-ea816b838dd4": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad74473f-c7db-476f-8013-ea816b838dd4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6617cfc7-9634-40f9-91a3-33de0009c3d7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "cb542b7bd0b06eb13d6219d6432eeadf5267896c28565e9b72c61de7121d364d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d91fa43-1f2d-415f-8142-c6bad249e8f4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "dc952cc6b62caf2aaaad81af1bdbe2763f2d3ebb37d23ff2e8aaa7c03af2daed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "20746f05-e9d7-48f6-8e21-4c4e64272994", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c7e899a39dd1039288db91cc33a16f29c4666eae850211c8521e6c76c213834", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Education ==\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe growth of Christianity, scholars state, was shaped from a foundation of cultural, religious and socio-political structure.\nA consequence of Hnatlang was the culture of Tlawmngaihna, which does not have a direct English translation. Tlawmngaihna as cultural concept incorporates behaviour that is self-sacrificing, self-denying, doing what an occasion demands unselfishly and without concern for inconvenience caused, persevering, stoical, stout-hearted, plucky, brave, firm, independent, loath to lose one's good reputation.Several other cultural elements of ancient Mizo tribes, some of which became less prevalent after arrival of Christianity, included:\nZawlbuk: a place near the chief's home, which served as defence camp in times of war, as well as \"bachelor house\" where the youth gathered and centre of village life.\nPathian: the term for god, to whom prayers and hymns were recited. The evil spirits were called ramhuai.\nNula-rim: the method of courtship in ancient culture. Courtship, pre-marital sex and polygamy were accepted. The man and the woman could have many partners. If the woman got pregnant, the man was required either marry or pay a substantial sum called Sawnman. If the woman's parents discover the relationship, they had a right to demand a payment called Khumpuikaiman. While pre-marital sex was accepted, a woman who was virgin at marriage was more highly esteemed than one who wasn't.\nPathlawi: a divorced man.\nRamri lehkha: a boundary drawing that identified a chief's tenured land called ram. Only the chief owned the land, and this ownership was hereditary. The tribe and village worked and harvested the land.\n\n\n=== Traditional festivals ===\nTraditional festivals in Mizoram often revolved around stages of jhum cultivation or the seasons. Community festivals were called kut in the local language, and there were major and minor kuts such as Chapchar Kut, Thalfavang Kut, Mim Kut and Pawl Kut. Chapchar Kut was the festival of spring (February/March), just before jhum started and land was cut-and-burnt for a new crop. Chapchar Kut was most anticipated by youth, a major festival and involved dancing and feasts. Thalfavang Kut celebrated completion of weeding of the jhum crop fields.Chapchar Kut was reintroduced and revived in 1973 by Mizo people to celebrate their heritage. Before Christianity arrived in Mizoram, home-brewed alcohol and many meat delicacies were part of the Chapchar celebrations. Now, with Mizoram's state law as a dry state, the youth busy themselves with music and community dancing. Along with reviving traditional festivals, the community has been reviving the traditional dances at these festivals, for example, dances such as Cheraw, Khuallam, Chheihlam and Chai.", "start_char_idx": 34452, "end_char_idx": 37216, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20746f05-e9d7-48f6-8e21-4c4e64272994": {"__data__": {"id_": "20746f05-e9d7-48f6-8e21-4c4e64272994", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6617cfc7-9634-40f9-91a3-33de0009c3d7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "cb542b7bd0b06eb13d6219d6432eeadf5267896c28565e9b72c61de7121d364d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad74473f-c7db-476f-8013-ea816b838dd4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "25031427bd2cdfe8e500f07c0390f2803ea9aa8e7725f51ac5a6681a1029368b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5179e55a-1f2e-4cae-a94e-ae61adf09856", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "430886d431508ab282382d389daf1db2be60e8c4934e93acace342b265a394db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Performing arts ==\nMizoram has many traditional dances, such as:\n\nCheraw \u2013 a dance that involves men holding bamboo close to the floor. They tap the sticks open and close with the rhythm of the music. Women in colourful dresses dance on top, stepping in between and out of the bamboo with the music. It requires coordination and skill.\nKhual Lam \u2013 a mixed-gender dance that traditionally celebrated successfully hunting with swaying cloth with singing and music.Chheih Lam \u2013 typically performed over cool evenings with rice beer, people sit in a circle with two or more dancers in the centre; they sing with impromptu often humorous compositions about recent events or guests between them with music and dancers keeping up. The song was called Chheih Hla. Mizo people have tried to introduce the Chheih Lam during church sermons with controversy.\nChai Lam \u2013 an important dance at the Chapchar Kut, this places the musicians in the centre while men and women in colourful dresses alternate and form a circle; the women held the men at their waist, while men held the women at their shoulders; they step forward to move in circles while swaying left and right with the music. A song may be sung which is also called Chai.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nMizoram's first football league debuted in October 2012. The Mizoram Premiere League had eight teams during the 2012\u20132013 season and is the highest level league in Mizoram. The eight clubs include Aizawl, Chanmari, Dinthar, FC Kulikawn, Luangmual, Mizoram, RS Annexe, and Reitlang. The season starts each year in October and wraps up with the finals in March.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== Domestic tourists ===\nThe state requires Indian citizens to have an Inner Line Permit. This is available from the Liaison officer, government of Mizoram in Kolkata, Silchar, Shillong, Guwahati and New Delhi. Those arriving by air can obtain a 15-day visit pass at Lengpui airport, Aizawl by submitting photographs and paying the fee of \u20b9120 (US$1.50).\n\n\n=== International tourists ===\nAlmost all foreign nationals can get the required Protected Area Permit on arrival, and face the same requirements as domestic tourists. However, they additionally have to register themselves with state police within 24 hours of arrival, a formality that most resorts can provide. Citizens of Afghanistan, China and Pakistan and foreign nationals having their origin in these countries are required to get the pass through the Indian consulate or from the Ministry of Home Affairs in New Delhi, before they arrive in Mizoram.\n\n\n=== Attractions ===\nMizoram is a place with flora and fauna rich landscape and pleasant climate.The state is a bird watcher's destination. For Mrs. Hume's pheasant (Syrmaticus humiae), Mizoram is a stronghold. Wild water buffalo, Sumatran rhinoceros, elephants and other mammals have been spotted in the past.\n\n\n== Issues ==\n\n\n=== Chakmaland ===\nHaving an estimated population of more than 100,000 per 2011 Indian census, the Chakmas have been demanding to convert the existing Chakma Autonomous District Council in Mizoram into a Union territory .", "start_char_idx": 37219, "end_char_idx": 40303, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5179e55a-1f2e-4cae-a94e-ae61adf09856": {"__data__": {"id_": "5179e55a-1f2e-4cae-a94e-ae61adf09856", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6617cfc7-9634-40f9-91a3-33de0009c3d7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "cb542b7bd0b06eb13d6219d6432eeadf5267896c28565e9b72c61de7121d364d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "20746f05-e9d7-48f6-8e21-4c4e64272994", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Mizoram.txt", "file_name": "Mizoram.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46007, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "15a132bb317abefa3b31298210026ab3224c4898227b7aa0c8124bba3c99ac13", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8e54b5b0-82db-42fb-9100-ffdbad4e0852", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bbab257e322b5fee9ffa3416a0ed892e92559569b901cdd77b4e01db1b0d3cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Issues ==\n\n\n=== Chakmaland ===\nHaving an estimated population of more than 100,000 per 2011 Indian census, the Chakmas have been demanding to convert the existing Chakma Autonomous District Council in Mizoram into a Union territory .\n\n\n=== Alcohol prohibition ===\nIn 1996, the government of Mizoram banned liquor. The church leaders (Mizoram Kohhran Hruaitute Committee) argue that state government should keep the ban and not seek to amend the law, while others argue prohibition should be lifted. However, it has been difficult to enforce the ban due to the high demand for alcohol.In 2008, the Mizoram Excise and Narcotics (Wine) Rules amended the ban of 1996 to allow the manufacture, export, sale, possession and consumption of wine in Mizoram made from grapes and guava which would help the economy of the state, reduce fruit waste from farms, and encourage large scale commercialisation. In 2011 the bill was amended to include apple, ginger, passion fruit, peach and pear wine.In 2013, the state assembly unanimously passed a resolution to study the impact of liquor prohibition. In 2014, the state's narcotics minister noted that the liquor ban had produced some serious problems in Mizo society due to the drinking of spurious and unhealthy (locally made) liquor, known as zu. The government suggested it would introduce an amended liquor bill allowing retail shops to operate in Aizawl and other district headquarters to sell liquor \u2013 but not in bars. Furthermore, they would not consult the powerful church on the issue.The Mizoram Liquor Prohibition and Control bill of 2014 was repealed on 20 March 2019 with the Mizoram Liquor Prohibition Bill 2019, it was a legislation promised by the Mizo National Front.\n\n\n=== Rat problems ===\nEvery 50 years, the Mautam bamboo blooms and its high-protein seeds lead to an explosion in the black rat population in the jungle, also referred to as the rat flood, which has historically destroyed entire villages' food supplies after rats move on to farm fields and devour crops. The 1958\u201359 plague provoked a rural uprising during which the indigenous Mizo people launched a violent 20-year rebellion against the central government. The dispute only saw final resolution in 1986. The 48-year rat problem re-occurred in Mizoram over 2006\u201308. The crops suffered massive damage, with yields at 30-year lows; the crop yields recovered sharply to pre-mautam levels in 2009 after the mautam passed.\n\n\n== Media and communication ==\nSee also Newspapers in Mizoram.Mizoram's media is growing quickly. Internet access is average, and private television cable channels are popular. Doordarshan, the national television service of India provides terrestrial broadcasting services and All India Radio broadcast programmes related to the indigenous culture and local news. Broadband access is available. In addition to these, there are several websites in local dialects. Print journalism remains a popular news medium in Mizoram; local newspapers include Vanglaini and Zalen.

It is bordered by the Indian states of Arunachal Pradesh to the north, Assam to the west, Manipur to the south, and the Naga Self-Administered Zone of the Sagaing Region of Myanmar (Burma) to the east. Its capital city is Kohima and its largest city is the twin Ch\u00fcmoukedima\u2013Dimapur. The state has an area of 16,579 square kilometres (6,401 sq mi) with a population of 1,980,602 as per the 2011 Census of India, making it one of the smallest states of India.Nagaland consists of 16 Administrative Districts, inhabited by 17 major tribes along with other sub-tribes. Each tribe is distinct in character from the other in terms of customs, language and dress. It is a land of folklore passed down the generations through word of mouth. The earliest recorded history of  the tribes of present-day Nagaland dates back to the 13th century.In the 19th century, the British India forces began expanding their influence in Northeast India, including the Naga Hills. After India's independence in 1947, the question of the Naga Hills' political status emerged. Nagaland was a district in the State of Assam until 1957, known to others as \u201cThe Naga Hills\u201d. The Naga National Council, led by Zapu Phizo, demanded an independent Naga state and launched an armed insurgency. The Indian Government, however, maintained that Nagaland was an integral part of the Indian Union. The conflict between the Naga National Council and the Indian Government resulted in a protracted insurgency. The State of Nagaland was formally inaugurated on 1 December 1963, as the 16th State of the Indian Union, and a democratically elected government took office in 1964.\nNagaland is home to a rich variety of natural, cultural, and environmental resources. It is a mountainous state and lies between the parallels of 95\u00b0 and 94\u00b0 eastern longitude and 25.2\u00b0 and 27.0\u00b0 latitude north. The high-profile Dz\u00fcko Valley is at Viswema, in the southern region of the state. The state has significant resources of natural minerals, petroleum, and hydropower, with agriculture as the state's most important economic activity, accounting for over 70% of its economy. Other significant activities include forestry, tourism, insurance, real estate, horticulture, and miscellaneous cottage industries.\n\n\n== Names and their etymologies ==\nThe origin of the word 'Naga' is unclear. A popularly accepted, but controversial, view is that it originated from the Burmese word Na-Ka' or 'Naga', meaning \"people with earrings.\" Others suggest it means pierced noses. In Burmese, Naka and Naga are pronounced the same way.Before the arrival of European colonialism in South Asia, there had been many wars, persecution and raids from Burma on the Nagas, Meiteis and others in India's northeast. The invaders came for \"head hunting\" and to seek wealth and captives from these tribes and ethnic groups. When the British inquired with Burmese guides about the people living in the northern Himalayas, they were told 'Naka'. This was recorded as 'Naga' and has been in use thereafter.\n\n\n== History ==", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3110, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89f116cb-c5a5-453a-84ce-f553b26be5c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "89f116cb-c5a5-453a-84ce-f553b26be5c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Nagaland.txt", "file_name": "Nagaland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 31556, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "daf812b2-0954-4702-ad9d-70cce5bd955f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Nagaland.txt", "file_name": "Nagaland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 31556, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "208a7600d3328fe065861805c549f96c381c079e775db80261dab305a94df89f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d654c234-a867-4646-92ff-b0efb18ede5f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Nagaland.txt", "file_name": "Nagaland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 31556, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "a09c70878f667278eec0464038901c98de8032871a538f24962b888b79bfd9af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "179d893a-bd83-487f-8712-70bd70e18e4a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d05f7ba62ebb08f803f7e421c7befc589a5defcc774a46e6100c9aebe0a80737", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nThe ancient history of the Nagas is unclear. Ethnic groups migrated at different times, each settling in the northeastern part of present India and establishing their respective sovereign mountain terrains and village states. There are no records of whether they came from the northern Mongolian region, southeast Asia, or southwest China, except that their origins are from the east of India, and historical records show the present-day Naga people settled before the arrival of the Ahoms in 1228 CE.\n\n\n=== British administration ===\nWith the arrival of the British East India Company in the early 19th century, followed by the British Raj, Britain expanded its domain over the whole of South Asia, including the Naga Hills. The first Europeans to enter the hills were Captain Francis Jenkins and Lieutenant Robert Pemberton in 1832. The early contact with the Naga ethnic groups was characterised by suspicion and conflict. The colonial interests in Assam, such as managers of tea estates and other trading posts led defensive action against raids from the ethnic groups who were known for their bravery and \"head hunting\" practices. To put an end to these raids, the British troops recorded 10 military expeditions between 1839 and 1850. In February 1851, at the bloody Battle of Kikr\u00fcma, people died on both the British side and the Kikr\u00fcma (Naga) side; in the days after the battle, inter-ethnic warfare followed that led to more bloodshed. After that war, the British adopted a policy of caution and non-interference with Naga ethnic groups.\nDespite this, colonists continued to move into Naga peoples' territory. Between 1851 and 1865, Naga ethnic groups continued to raid the British in Assam. The British India Government took over the holdings of the East Indian Company following the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The failings and atrocities of the East Indian Company led the British Crown to review its governance structure throughout South Asia including its northeastern region. In 1866, the British India administration established a post at Samaguting with the explicit goal of ending intertribal warfare and tribal raids on property and personnel.In 1869, Captain Butler was appointed to lead and consolidate the British presence in the Nagaland Hills. In 1878, the headquarters were transferred to Kohima \u2014 creating a city that remains an important center of administration, commerce, and culture for Nagaland.On 4 October 1879, British political agent G. H. Damant went to Khonoma with troops, where he was shot dead with 35 of his team. Kohima was subsequently attacked and the stockade looted. This violence led to a determined effort by the British Raj to return and respond. The subsequent defeat of Khonoma marked the end of serious and persistent ultimatums in the Naga Hills.Between 1880 and 1922, the British administration consolidated their position over a large area of the Naga Hills and integrated it into its Assam operations. The British administration enforced the rupee as the currency for economic activity and a system of structured ethnic government that was very different from historic social governance practices.In parallel, since the mid-19th century, Christian missionaries from the United States and Europe, stationed in India, reached into Nagaland and neighbouring states, converting Nagaland's Naga ethnic groups from animism to Christianity.", "start_char_idx": 3097, "end_char_idx": 6520, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "179d893a-bd83-487f-8712-70bd70e18e4a": {"__data__": {"id_": "179d893a-bd83-487f-8712-70bd70e18e4a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Nagaland.txt", "file_name": "Nagaland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 31556, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "daf812b2-0954-4702-ad9d-70cce5bd955f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Nagaland.txt", "file_name": "Nagaland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 31556, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "208a7600d3328fe065861805c549f96c381c079e775db80261dab305a94df89f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "89f116cb-c5a5-453a-84ce-f553b26be5c5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Nagaland.txt", "file_name": "Nagaland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 31556, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "d98a12a8ced137d7ca5517c4175b8dc872eb5c535dacef4ece345fdee2efaf4b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bbfdb789-6df0-4942-9b6e-66067e54fefe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1badd54acd8f407669b706a67915346541abd9d775f4d369e9c50e556234ad90", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== World War II ===\n \n\nIn 1944, during World War II, the Japanese Army, with the help of the Indian National Army led by Netaji Subhashchandra Bose, invaded through Burma and attempted to take India through Kohima. The population was evacuated. British India soldiers defended the area of Kohima and having lost many of their original force were relieved by British in June 1944.\nTogether the British and Indian troops successfully repelled the Japanese troops.\nThe battle was fought from 4 April to 22 June 1944 from the town of Kohima, coordinated with action at Imphal, Manipur. The Indian National Army lost half their numbers, many through starvation, and were forced to withdraw through Burma.There is the World War II Cemetery, and the War Museum, in honour of those who died during World War II during the fighting between the British Empire and Japanese troops. Nearly 4,000 British Empire troops died, along with 3,000 Japanese. Many of those who died were Naga people, particularly the Angami Nagas. Near the memorial is the Kohima Cathedral, on Aradura Hill, built with funds from the families and friends of deceased Japanese soldiers. Prayers are held in Kohima for peace and in memory of the fallen of both sides of the battle.\n\n\n=== Naga national awakening ===\nIn 1929, a memorandum was submitted to the Simon Statutory Commission, requesting that the Nagas be exempt from reforms and new taxes proposed in British India, should be left alone to determine their own future.The Naga Memorandum submitted by the Naga Club (which later became the Naga National Council) to the Simon Commission explicitly stated, 'to leave us alone to determine ourselves as in ancient times.'\n\n\n=== Post-independence history ===\nAfter the independence of India in 1947, the area remained a part of the province of Assam. Nationalist activities arose amongst a section of the Nagas. Phizo-led Naga National Council demanded a political union of their ancestral and native groups. The movement led to a series of violent incidents, that damaged government and civil infrastructure, attacked government officials and civilians. The central government sent the Indian Army in 1955, to restore order. In 1957, an agreement was reached between Naga leaders and the Indian government, creating a single separate region of the Naga Hills. The Tuensang frontier was united with this single political region, Naga Hills Tuensang Area (NHTA), and it became a union territory directly administered by the central government with a large degree of autonomy. This was not satisfactory to the Nagas, however, and agitation with violence increased across the state \u2013 including attacks on army and government institutions, banks, as well as non-payment of taxes. In July 1960, following discussion between Prime Minister Nehru and the leaders of the Naga People Convention (NPC), a 16-point agreement was arrived at whereby the Government of India recognised the formation of Nagaland as a full-fledged state within the Union of India.", "start_char_idx": 6523, "end_char_idx": 9539, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbfdb789-6df0-4942-9b6e-66067e54fefe": {"__data__": {"id_": "bbfdb789-6df0-4942-9b6e-66067e54fefe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Nagaland.txt", "file_name": "Nagaland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 31556, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "daf812b2-0954-4702-ad9d-70cce5bd955f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Nagaland.txt", "file_name": "Nagaland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 31556, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "208a7600d3328fe065861805c549f96c381c079e775db80261dab305a94df89f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "179d893a-bd83-487f-8712-70bd70e18e4a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Nagaland.txt", "file_name": "Nagaland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 31556, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "5f32f3f4d0f69d0a2b3c0d98e2e332bd8521d6bb7cbd3a14c379e46bdaf45002", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "821ed91e-0e1f-4d13-9a78-1373312d69be", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9aa9ad1b8ca0f540df8e510a718384a17e2480f3eb3a5a31589fed29a215904d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Nagaland statehood and late 20th century ===\nAccordingly, the territory was placed under the Nagaland Transitional Provisions Regulation, 1961 which provided for an Interim body consisting of 45 members to be elected by tribes according to the customs, traditions and usage of the respective tribes. Subsequently, Nagaland attained statehood with the enactment of the state of Nagaland Act in 1962 by the Parliament. The interim body was dissolved on 30 November 1963 and the state of Nagaland was formally inaugurated on 1 December 1963 and Kohima was declared as the state capital. After elections in January 1964, the first democratically elected Nagaland Legislative Assembly was constituted on 11 February 1964.The rebel activity continued in many Naga inhabited areas both in India and Burma. Ceasefires were announced and negotiations continued, but this did little to stop the violence. In March 1975, a direct presidential rule was imposed by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on the state. In November 1975, some leaders of largest rebellion groups agreed to lay down their arms and accept the Indian constitution, a small group did not agree and continued their insurgent activity. The Nagaland Baptist Church Council played an important role by initiating peace efforts in the 1960s.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2004, two powerful bombs were set off on the same day and struck the Dimapur Railway Station and the Hong Kong Market, resulting in 30 deaths and wounding over 100 others in the deadliest terrorist attack in Nagaland to date.Over the 5-year period of 2009 to 2013, between 0 and 11 civilians died per year in Nagaland from rebellion related activity (or less than 1 death per 100,000 people), and between 3 and 55 militants died per year in inter-factional killings (or between 0 and 3 deaths per 100,000 people).In early 2017, Nagaland went into a state of civil unrest and protests in response to the announcement to implement 33% women's reservation in the Civic Elections.On 4 December 2021, a unit of the 21st Para Special Forces of the Indian Army killed six civilian labourers near Oting Village in the Mon District of Nagaland. Eight more civilians and a soldier were killed in subsequent violence. The incident was widely condemned, with many calling out to repeal and revoke the Armed Forces Special Powers Act.The most recent Nagaland Legislative Assembly election took place on 27 February 2023 to elect the Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) in the 60 Assembly Constituencies in the state. A voter turnout of 87% was observed in the election. The election created history by electing two women candidates for the first time in Nagaland \u2014 Hekani Jakhalu Kense and Salhoutuonuo Kruse. Both candidates were from the ruling Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP). Salhoutuonuo Kruse later became the first woman minister of the Nagaland Legislative Assembly.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTwenty per cent of the total land area of the state is covered with wooded forest, a haven for flora and fauna.

Census reports up to 1951 listed just one settlement in Nagaland as a town, the capital Kohima. The next two settlements, Dimapur and Mokokchung were listed as towns from 1961. Four more towns appeared in 1981, Tuensang, Wokha, Mon and Z\u00fcnheboto.The relatively slow rate of urbanisation in Nagaland was described in the 1980s as being an effect of (a) the largely administrative roles of the towns, except for Dimapur which had a more diversified economy, and (b) a low level of mobility among the tribes of Nagaland, scheduled tribes constituting nearly 90% of the population.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe population of Nagaland consists of almost 2.2 million people, consisting of 1.04 million males and 0.95 million females. Among its districts, Kohima has the largest population (270,063) followed by Dimapur (170,000). The least populated district is Longleng (50,593). 75% of the population lives in the rural areas. As of 2013, about 10% of rural population is below the poverty line; among the people living in urban areas 4.3% of them are below the poverty line.The state showed a population drop between the 2001 census and the 2011 census, the only state to show a population drop in the census. This has been attributed, by scholars, to incorrect counting in past censuses; the 2011 census in Nagaland is considered most reliable so far.The largest urban agglomerations are centred upon Dimapur (122,834) and Kohima (115,283).\nOther major towns (and 2011 census populations) are Tuensang (36,774), Mokokchung (35,913), Wokha (35,004), Mon (26,328), Ch\u00fcmoukedima (25,885), Z\u00fcnheboto (22,633), Kiphire (16,487), Kuda (16,108), Kohima Village (15,734), Phek (14,204), Pf\u00fctsero (10,371) and Diphupar 'A' (10,246).\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nThe state is home to 15 major Naga ethnic groups \u2013 Angami, Ao, Chakhesang, Chang, Khiamniungan, Konyak, Lotha, Phom, Pochury, Rengma, Sangtam, S\u00fcmi, Tikhir, Yimkhiung, Zeme-Liangmai (Zeliang) and 2 other ethnic groups namely Kuki and Kachari with decent number of community.Some other minor tribes or subtribes are Garo, Karbi, Chirr, Makury, and Rongmei.There are also sizeable populations of non-native communities like Bengalis, Marwaris, Nepalis, Punjabis and others living mostly around Dimapur City.", "start_char_idx": 15330, "end_char_idx": 17975, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8297b58a-b131-4232-a938-e1b8ac33aa21": {"__data__": {"id_": "8297b58a-b131-4232-a938-e1b8ac33aa21", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Nagaland.txt", "file_name": "Nagaland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 31556, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "daf812b2-0954-4702-ad9d-70cce5bd955f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Nagaland.txt", "file_name": "Nagaland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 31556, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "208a7600d3328fe065861805c549f96c381c079e775db80261dab305a94df89f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0ee2c345-c339-4ad6-9070-d529c6c1ecd9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Nagaland.txt", "file_name": "Nagaland.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 31556, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "f51e0ed925627b098535f1b42791b40893589ddb2e904774ee0feebd0e2723e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9de0bafc-7436-4d31-9838-4c759fc700bf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "89b3fb001e22916ea0e6fee9d42528a599dae1732cf49b8df9191fab473a5fc8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Languages ===\n\nNaga people form the majority of the population. According to the 2011 census there are 2 million people living in Nagaland. The Naga people number around 1.8 million in the state, constituting over 90% of the population. These belong mostly to the Sino-Tibetan language family. Shafer came up with his own classification system for languages found in and around Nagaland.In 1967, the Nagaland Assembly proclaimed Indian English as the official language of Nagaland and it is the medium for education in Nagaland. Other than English, Nagamese, a creole language based on Assamese, is widely spoken.The major languages spoken as per the 2011 census are Konyak (244,135), Ao (231,084), Lotha (177,488), Angami (151,883), Chokri (91,010), Sangtam (75,841), Bengali (74,753), Zeme (71,954; covering Zeliang, 60,399 and Zemi, 11,165), Yimkhiungr\u00fc (74,156), Chang (65,632), Khiamniungan (61,906), Rengma (61,537), Phom (53,674), Nepali (43,481), Kuzhami (34,218), Pochury (21,446), Kuki (18,391), Chakhesang (17,919), Assamese (17,201), Bodo (12,243; covering Bodo 7,372 and Dimasa 4,871), Manipuri (9,511), Sema (8,268), etc.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\n\n==== Christianity ====\n\nThe state's population is 1.978 million, out of which over 90% are Abrahamics in general and 88% are Christians in particular.Nagaland is known as \"the only predominantly Baptist State in the World\" and \"the most Baptist State in the World.\"Christianity arrived in Nagaland in the early 19th century. The American Baptist Naga mission grew out of the Assam mission in 1836. Miles Bronson, Nathan Brown and other Christian missionaries working out of Jaipur to bring Christianity to the Indian subcontinent, saw the opportunity for gaining converts since many parts of India's northeast was principally animist and folk religion-driven. Along with other tribal regions of the northeast, the people of Nagaland converted to Christianity.\n\n\n==== Hinduism ====\n\nHinduism is the second largest religion in Nagaland. Hindus are concentrated mainly in the erstwhile Dimapur District (as per the 2011 Census of India, comprising the present districts of Dimapur, Niuland, and Ch\u00fcmoukedima) (28.75%) and Kohima District (9.51%).

The majority of the population in the state speaks English, which is the official language of the state. The state offers technical and medical education. Nevertheless, agriculture and forestry contribute a majority of Nagaland's Gross Domestic Product. The state is rich in mineral resources such as coal, limestone, iron, nickel, cobalt, chromium, and marble.\nPlantation crops such as premium coffee, cardamom, and tea are grown in hilly areas in small quantities with large growth potential. Most people cultivate rice as it is the main staple diet of the people. About 80% of the cropped area is dedicated to rice. Oilseeds is another, higher income crop gaining ground in Nagaland. The farm productivity for all crops is low, compared to other Indian states, suggesting a significant opportunity for farmer income increase. Currently, the Jhum to Terraced cultivation ratio is 4:3; where Jhum is the local name for cut-and-burn shift farming. Jhum farming is ancient, causes a lot of pollution and soil damage, yet accounts for the majority of the farmed area. The state does not produce enough food and depends on the trade of food from other states of India.Tourism has a lot of potentials but was largely limited due to insurgency and concern of terrorist violence over the last five decades. More recently, a number of Small Medium Enterprises and private sector companies have actively promoted Nagaland tourism, helping initiate a growing tourism market. Tourism experts contend that the state's uniqueness and strategic location in northeast India give Nagaland an advantage in tapping into the tourism sector for economic growth.The state generates 87.98 MU compared to a demand for 242.88 MU. This deficit requires Nagaland to buy power. The state has significant hydroelectric potential, which if realised could make the state a power surplus state.

To achieve these goals a man, whatever his ascendancy, had to be a headhunter or great warrior, have many sexual conquests among women, or complete a series of merit feasts.The Feasts of Merit reflected the splendor and celebration of Naga life. Only married men could give such Feasts, and his wife took a prominent and honoured place during the ritual which emphasised male-female co-operation and interdependence. His wife brewed the beer which he offered to the guests. The event displayed ceremonies and festivities organised by the sponsor. The Feast given by a wealthier community person would be more extravagant. He would typically invite everyone from the ethnic group. This event bestowed honour to the couple from the community.

The city is also the administrative centre of the Odesa Raion and Odesa Oblast, as well as a multiethnic cultural centre. As of January 2021, Odesa's population was approximately 1,010,537. On 25 January 2023, its historic city centre was declared a World Heritage Site and added to the List of World Heritage in Danger by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee in recognition of its influence on cinema, literature, and the arts. The declaration was made in response to the bombing of Odesa during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has damaged or destroyed buildings across the city.\nIn classical antiquity a large Greek settlement existed at its location no later than the middle of the 6th century BC. It has been researched as a possible site of the ancient Greek settlement of Histria.\nThe first chronicle mention of the Slavic settlement-port of Kotsiubijiv, which was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, dates back to 1415, when a ship was sent from here to Constantinople by sea. After the Grand Duchy lost control, the port and its surroundings became part of the domain of the Ottoman Empire in 1529, under the name Hacibey, and remained in it until the Ottomans' defeat in the Russo-Turkish War (1787\u20131792).\nIn 1794, a decree of the Russian empress Catherine II was issued to establish a navy harbor and trading place in Khadjibey, which was named Odessa soon after. From 1819 to 1858, Odesa was a free port. During the Soviet period, it was an important trading port and a naval base.\nDuring the 19th century, Odesa was the fourth largest city of the Russian Empire, after Moscow, Saint Petersburg and Warsaw. Its historical architecture is more Mediterranean than Russian, having been heavily influenced by French and Italian styles. Some buildings are built in a mixture of different styles, including Art Nouveau, Renaissance and Classicist.Odesa is a warm-water port. The city of Odesa hosts both the Port of Odesa and Port Pivdennyi, a significant oil terminal situated in the city's suburbs. Another notable port, Chornomorsk, is located in the same oblast, to the south-west of Odesa. Together they represent a major transport hub integrating with railways. Odesa's oil and chemical processing facilities are connected to the Russian and other European networks by strategic pipelines.

Catherine's Secretary of State Adrian Gribovsky claimed in his memoirs that the name was his suggestion. Some expressed doubts about this claim, while others noted the reputation of Gribovsky as an honest and modest man. Odesa is located between the ancient Greek cities of Tyras and Olbia and it was named using a Slavic feminine form for the ancient Greek city of Odessos (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2; in Roman times, Odessus). This refers to the second ancient Odessos, founded between the end of the 5th and beginning of the 4th centuries BC (the first one, identified with modern Varna in Bulgaria, is the older of the two, founded c. 610 BC). The exact location of this ancient Odessos is unknown, but modern efforts have attempted to localize it 40 km northeast of Odesa, near the village of Koshary, Odesa Oblast., near the Tylihul Estuary.Odessa, the transliteration of the name from Russian, was the traditional English spelling of the city's name favoured before Ukraine's independence in 1991 (similarly to the spelling of Kyiv versus Kiev).  \nOdesa became the internationally standardized Latin-alphabet transliteration of the Ukrainian name according to the Ukrainian National romanization system, which was adopted for official use by Ukraine's cabinet in 2010, approved by the UN Group of Experts on Geographical Names in 2012, and adopted by the BGN/PCGN in 2019. This spelling appears in Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica and in dictionaries as the spelling for the Ukrainian city. As noted by the Christian Science Monitor, many in the English-language media outlets historically spelled the city Odessa, even after changing the spelling of Kiev to Kyiv, but since the beginning of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine more outlets and style guides have been shifting away from Russian transliterations. \n\n\n== History ==", "start_char_idx": 2660, "end_char_idx": 4914, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25b22560-8d5a-4ee4-be71-648d0122cf62": {"__data__": {"id_": "25b22560-8d5a-4ee4-be71-648d0122cf62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Odisha.txt", "file_name": "Odisha.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 64173, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0e65315f-9f60-4250-b9b7-d72121e2ddde", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Odisha.txt", "file_name": "Odisha.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 64173, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "c19afb14d80814d54a8c7dbe917ac144b1354da27cb6e3121195a8071f5247af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "264885d0-29ca-4302-bf34-3601073776b7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Odisha.txt", "file_name": "Odisha.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 64173, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "3a4a3926ffeda44cd69d9fa6056839366fd6ba66ad8bd7ef9145d63d4cb4572c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "67a57b0f-e2bc-4673-a9a2-2e8738280730", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a4a05c85ee7e65f2d92cbed4932e69e8004a0875906d2cff1f1f2977fdeb7d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nOdesa was the site of a large Greek settlement no later than the middle of the 6th century BC (a necropolis from the 5th\u20133rd centuries BC has long been known in this area). Some scholars believe it to have been a trade settlement established by the Greek city of Histria. Whether the Bay of Odesa is the ancient \"Port of the Histrians\" cannot yet be considered a settled question based on the available evidence. Archaeological artifacts confirm extensive links between the Odesa area and the eastern Mediterranean.\nIn the Middle Ages successive rulers of the Odesa region included various nomadic tribes (Petchenegs, Cumans), the Golden Horde, the Crimean Khanate, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Ottoman Empire. Yedisan Crimean Tatars traded there in the 14th century.\nSince the middle of the 13th century the city's territory belonged to the Golden Horde domain. On Italian navigational maps of 14th century on the place of Odesa is indicated the castle of Ginestra, at the time the center of a Gazarian colony of the Republic of Genoa. During the reign of Khan Hac\u0131 I Giray of Crimea (1441\u20131466), the Khanate was endangered by the Golden Horde and the Ottoman Turks and, in search of allies, the khan agreed to cede the area to Lithuania. The site of present-day Odesa was then a fortress known as Khadjibey (named for Hac\u0131 I Giray, and also spelled Kocibey in English, Hac\u0131bey or Hocabey in Turkish, and Hac\u0131bey in Crimean Tatar). Khadjibey was first mentioned in 1415 in Polish chronicles by Jan D\u0142ugosz, when a ship with grain sailed from there to Constantinople. By the middle of the 15th century, the settlement was depopulated.\n\n\n=== Ottoman conquest ===\nKhadjibey came under direct control of the Ottoman Empire after 1529. In the mid-18th century, the Ottomans rebuilt the fortress at Khadjibey (also known as Hocabey), which was named Yeni D\u00fcnya (literally \"New World\").\n\n\n=== Russian conquest of Sanjak of \u00d6zi (Ochakiv Oblast) ===\nA series of wars between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire, as well as the demise of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, allowed Russia to start to fully exploit the ancient Black Sea trade across the coastal area through the steppe across southern and eastern Ukraine, into the hinterland of East Central Europe. Stable commercial activity in this region in practice in the past required both security through the overland routes, and knowledge of where products could go overseas. In antiquity, various Greek colonies had taken this role, followed by the Varangians who established Kievan Rus' in the 9th century, as well as various Italian colonies after the Mongol invasion of Europe.:\u200a1-3\u200a Under Catherine the Great, Russia gained, via the Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca, the lands where Mariupol, Kherson, and Mykolaiv would be founded. However, they were all handicapped in various ways relative to how much commercial interest there was.

One section of the troops came under command of a Spaniard in Russian service, Irishman Major General Jos\u00e9 de Ribas (known in Russia as Osip Mikhailovich Deribas); today, the main street in Odesa, Deribasivska Street, is named after him.\nRussia formally gained possession of the Sanjak of \u00d6zi (Ochakiv Oblast) as a result of the Treaty of Jassy (Ia\u015fi) in 1792 and it became a part of Yekaterinoslav Viceroyalty. The Russian Empire took full control of Crimea, as well as land between the Southern Bug and the Dniester, including the Khadzhibey Estuary where the Turkish fortress of Khadjibey was located. The newly acquired Ochakov Oblast was promised to the Cossacks by the Russian government for resettlement. On permission of the Archbishop of Yekaterinoslav Amvrosiy, the Black Sea Kosh Host, that was located around the area between Bender and Ochakiv, built second after Sucleia wooden church of Saint Nicholas.By the Highest rescript of 17 June 1792 addressed to General Kakhovsky it was ordered to establish the Dniester Border Line of fortresses. The commander of the land forces in Ochakiv Oblast was appointed Graf (Count) Suvorov-Rymnikskiy. The main fortress was built near Sucleia at the mouth of river Botna as the Head Dniester Fortress by Engineer-Major de Wollant. Near the new fortress saw the formation of a new \"Vorstadt\" (suburb) where people moved from Sucleia and Parkan. With the establishment of the Voznesensk Governorate on 27 January 1795, the Vorstadt was named Tiraspol.The Flemish engineer working for the Russian Empress Catherine the Great, Jos\u00e9 de Ribas's collaborator Franz de Voland recommended the area of Khadjibey fortress as the site for the region's basic port: it had an ice-free harbor, breakwaters could be cheaply constructed that would render the harbor safe and it would have the capacity to accommodate large fleets. The Namestnik of Yekaterinoslav and Voznesensk, Platon Zubov (one of Catherine's favorites), supported this proposal. In 1794 Catherine issued a Rescript to Jos\u00e9 de Ribas: \"Considering favorable Khadjibey location... I order to establish here a navy harbor and trading pierce...\" and invested the first money (26.000 rubles) in construction.

Franz de Voland drew up a plan that would end up being the city's plan.:\u200a7\u200a\nHowever, adjacent to the new official locality, a Moldavian colony already existed, which by the end of the 18th century was an independent settlement named Moldavanka. Some local historians consider that the settlement predates Odesa by about thirty years and assert that the locality was founded by Moldavians who came to build the fortress of Yeni Dunia for the Ottomans and eventually settled in the area in the late 1760s, right next to the settlement of Khadjibey, on what later became the Primorsky Boulevard. Another version posits that the settlement appeared after Odesa itself was founded, as a settlement of Moldavians, Greeks, and Albanians fleeing the Ottoman yoke.Under Paul I of Russia, construction of Odesa was stopped, Franz de Voland was removed from the project, and Jos\u00e9 de Ribas was implicated in a plot to assassinate the Emperor. After Paul's assassination in 1801, the city resumed construction, and used a plan largely from de Voland's work. It was thus one of the few master planned cities in the Russian Empire. :\u200a13\u200a\n\n\n=== Renaming of the settlement and establishment of sea port ===\nIn 1795, Khadjibey was officially renamed with the feminine name \"\u041e\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430 (Odessa)\" after a Greek colony of Odessos that supposedly was located in the area. The first census that was conducted in Odesa was in 1797 which accounted for 3,455 people. Since 1795, the city had its own city magistrate, and since 1796 a city council of six members and the Odesa Commodity Exchange. In 1801, in Odesa had opened the first commercial bank. In 1803, the city accounted for 9,000 people.\nIn their settlement, also known as Novaya Slobodka, the Moldavians owned relatively small plots on which they built village-style houses and cultivated vineyards and gardens. What became Mykhailovsky Square was the center of this settlement and the site of its first Orthodox church, the Church of the Dormition, built in 1821 close to the seashore, as well as a cemetery. Nearby stood the military barracks and the country houses (dacha) of the city's wealthy residents, including that of the Duc de Richelieu, appointed by Tsar Alexander I as Governor of Odesa in 1803. Richelieu played a role during Ottoman plague epidemic which hit Odesa in the autumn 1812. Dismissive of any attempt to forge a compromise between quarantine requirements and free trade, Prince Kuriakin (the Saint Petersburg-based High Commissioner for Sanitation) countermanded Richelieu's orders.In the period from 1795 to 1814, the population of Odesa increased 15 times over and reached almost 20 thousand people. The first city plan was designed by the engineer F. Devollan in the late 18th century.

Devollan in the late 18th century. Colonists of various ethnicities settled mainly in the area of the former colony, outside of the official boundaries, and as a consequence, in the first third of the 19th century, Moldavanka emerged as the dominant settlement. After planning by the official architects who designed buildings in Odesa's central district, such as the Italians Francesco Carlo Boffo and Giovanni Torricelli (see Italians of Odesa), Moldovanka was included in the general city plan, though the original grid-like plan of Moldovankan streets, lanes, and squares remained unchanged.The new city quickly became a major success although initially, it received little state funding and privileges. Its early growth owed much to the work of the Duc de Richelieu, who served as the city's governor between 1803 and 1814. Having fled the French Revolution, he had served in Catherine's army against the Turks. He is credited with designing the city and organizing its amenities and infrastructure, and is considered one of the founding fathers of Odesa, together with another Frenchman, Count Andrault de Langeron, who succeeded him in office.\nRichelieu is commemorated by a bronze statue, unveiled in 1828 to a design by Ivan Martos. His contributions to the city are mentioned by Mark Twain in his travelogue Innocents Abroad: \"I mention this statue and this stairway because they have their story. Richelieu founded Odessa \u2013 watched over it with paternal care \u2013 labored with a fertile brain and a wise understanding for its best interests \u2013 spent his fortune freely to the same end \u2013 endowed it with a sound prosperity, and one which will yet make it one of the great cities of the Old World\".\nIn 1819, Odesa became a free port, a status it retained until 1859. Odesa became home to an extremely diverse population of Albanians, Armenians, Azeris, Bulgarians, Crimean Tatars, Frenchmen, Germans (including Mennonites), Greeks, Italians, Jews, Poles, Romanians, Russians, Turks, Ukrainians, and traders representing many other nationalities (hence numerous \"ethnic\" names on the city's map, for example Frantsuzky (French) and Italiansky (Italian) Boulevards, Grecheskaya (Greek), Yevreyskaya (Jewish), Arnautskaya (Albanian) Streets).\nThe Filiki Eteria, a Greek freemasonry-style society that was to play an important role in the Greek War of Independence, was founded in Odesa in 1814 before relocating to Constantinople in 1818. Odesa's cosmopolitan nature was documented by the great Russian poet Alexander Pushkin, who lived in internal exile in Odesa between 1823 and 1824. In his letters, he wrote that Odesa was a city where \"the air is filled with all Europe, French is spoken and there are European papers and magazines to read\".\nOdesa's growth was interrupted by the Crimean War of 1853\u20131856, during which it was bombarded by British and Imperial French naval forces. It soon recovered and the growth in trade made Odesa Russia's largest grain-exporting port.

The community, however, was repeatedly subjected to anti-Semitism and anti-Jewish agitation from almost all Christian segments of the population. Pogroms were carried out in 1821, 1859, 1871, 1881 and 1905. Many Odesan Jews fled abroad after 1882, particularly to the Ottoman region that became Palestine, and the city became an important base of support for Zionism.\n\n\n=== Beginnings of revolution ===\n\nIn 1905, Odesa was the site of a workers' uprising supported by the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin and the Menshevik's Iskra. Sergei Eisenstein's famous motion picture The Battleship Potemkin commemorated the uprising and included a scene where hundreds of Odesan citizens were murdered on the great stone staircase (now popularly known as the \"Potemkin Steps\"), in one of the most famous scenes in motion picture history. At the top of the steps, which lead down to the port, stands a statue of the Duc de Richelieu.The actual massacre took place in streets nearby, not on the steps themselves, but the film caused many to visit Odesa to see the site of the \"slaughter\". The \"Odesa Steps\" continue to be a tourist attraction in Odesa. The film was made at Odesa's Cinema Factory, one of the oldest cinema studios in the former Soviet Union.Following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 during Ukrainian-Soviet War, Odesa saw two Bolshevik armed insurgencies, the second of which succeeded in establishing their control over the city; for the following months, the city became a center of the Odesa Soviet Republic. After signing of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty all Bolshevik forces were driven out by 13 March 1918 by the combined armed forces of the Austro-Hungarian Army, providing support to the Ukrainian People's Republic.With the end of the World War I and the withdrawal of armies of Central Powers, the Soviet forces fought for control over the country with the army of the Ukrainian People's Republic. A few months later the city was occupied by the French Army and the Greek Army that supported the Russian White Army in its struggle with the Bolsheviks. The Ukrainian general Nykyfor Hryhoriv who sided with Bolsheviks managed to drive the Triple Entente forces out of the city, but Odesa was soon retaken by the Russian White Army. By 1920 the Soviet Red Army managed to overpower both the Ukrainian and Russian White Army and secure the city.\nThe people of Odesa suffered badly from a famine that resulted from the Russian Civil War in 1921\u20131922 due to the Soviet policies of prodrazverstka.

The defense of Odesa started on 5 August 1941 and lasted for 73 days. The defense was organized on three lines with emplacements consisting of trenches, anti-tank ditches and pillboxes. The first line was 80 kilometres (50 miles) long and situated some 25 to 30 kilometres (16 to 19 miles) from the city. The second and main line of defense was situated 6 to 8 kilometres (3.7 to 5.0 miles) from the city and was about 30 kilometres (19 miles) long. The third and last line of defense was organized inside the city itself. Lyudmila Pavlichenko, the famous female sniper, took part in the battle for Odesa. She recorded 187 confirmed kills during the defense of Odesa. Pavlichenko's confirmed kills during World War II totaled 309 (including 36 enemy snipers).\n\nThe city fell to the Axis on 16 October 1941, and it was henceforth subject to Romanian administration. By that time, the Soviet authorities had been able to evacuate 200,000 people as well as weaponry and industrial equipment. A day later, Odesa was made the capital of Transnistria. Partisan fighting continued, however, in the city's catacombs.\nFollowing the siege, and the Axis occupation, approximately 25,000 Odesans were murdered in the outskirts of the city and over 35,000 deported; this came to be known as the Odesa massacre. Most of the atrocities were committed during the first six months of the occupation which officially began on 17 October 1941, when 80% of the 210,000 Jews in the region were killed, compared to Jews in Romania proper where the majority survived. After the Nazi forces began to lose ground on the Eastern Front, the Romanian administration changed its policy, refusing to deport the remaining Jewish population to extermination camps in German occupied Poland, and allowing Jews to work as hired labourers. As a result, despite the events of 1941, the survival of the Jewish population in this area was higher than in other areas of occupied eastern Europe.A Soviet medal, \"For the Defence of Odesa\", was established on 22 December 1942. It was one of the first four Soviet cities to be awarded the title of \"Hero City\" in 1945. (The others were Leningrad, Stalingrad, and Sevastopol).\nThe city suffered severe damage and sustained many casualties over the course of the war. Many parts of Odesa were damaged during both its siege and recapture on 10 April 1944, when the city was finally liberated by the Red Army. Some of the Odesans had a more favourable view of the Romanian occupation, in contrast with the Soviet official view that the period was exclusively a time of hardship, deprivation, oppression and suffering \u2013 claims embodied in public monuments and disseminated through the media to this day.

It is known for its large outdoor market \u2013 the Seventh-Kilometer Market, the largest of its kind in Europe.\nOdesa was a contender for hosting Euro 2012 football matches in, but lost the competition to other cities in Ukraine.The city saw violence in the 2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine during the 2014 Odesa clashes. The 2 May 2014 Odesa clashes between pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian protestors killed 42 people. Four were killed during the protests, and at least 32 trade unionists were killed after a trade union building was set on fire after Molotov cocktails exchange between sides.

Internal Affairs Ministry advisor Zorian Shkiryak said on 25 December that Odesa and Kharkiv had become \"cities which are being used to escalate tensions\" in Ukraine. Shkiryak said that he suspected that these cities were singled out because of their \"geographic position\". On 5 January 2015 the city's Euromaidan Coordination Center and a cargo train car were (non-lethally) bombed.Until 18 July 2020, Odesa was incorporated as a city of oblast significance. In July 2020, as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Odesa Oblast to seven, the city of Odesa was merged into newly established Odesa Raion.In the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the city faced some Russian bombing attacks. On 23 April 2022, Russian troops bombarded Odesa with cruise missiles. They destroyed both the city's military infrastructure and residential buildings, killing eight people and wounding another eighteen people. In addition, the Russian military destroyed more than 1,000 m2 of the territory of the cemetery. The city suffered further aerial attacks on regional infrastructure facilities in October 2022, cutting off power to 10,500 households and injuring three people.On 25 January 2023, UNESCO announced that the historical city center of Odesa was added to UNESCO's World Heritage List.

The city lies on the northwestern coast of the Black Sea along the southwestern shore of the Gulf of Odesa, approximately 31 km (19 mi) north of the estuary of the Dniester river and some 443 km (275 mi) south of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. The international border between Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova lies some 40 km (25 mi) west of the city.\nThe city is situated on terraced hills overlooking a small harbor. The average elevation at which the city is located is around 50 metres (160 feet). The maximum is 65 metres (213 feet) and minimum (on the coast) amounts to 4.2 metres (13.8 feet) above sea level. There are three large estuaries near the city: Kuialnyk, Khadzhibey and Sukhyi.\nThe city currently covers a territory of 162.42 km2 (63 sq mi). The population density for which is around 6,139 persons/km2. Sources of running water in the city include the Dniester River, from which water is taken and then purified at a processing plant just outside the city.

Flora is of the deciduous variety and Odesa is known for its tree-lined avenues which, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, made the city a favourite year-round retreat for the Russian aristocracy.The city's location on the coast of the Black Sea has also helped to create a booming tourist industry in Odesa. The city's Arkadia beach has long been a favourite place for relaxation, both for the city's inhabitants and its visitors. This is a large sandy beach which is located to the south of the city centre. Odesa's many sandy beaches are considered to be quite unique in Ukraine, as the country's southern coast (particularly in the Crimea) tends to be a location in which the formation of stoney and pebble beaches has proliferated.\nThe coastal cliffs adjacent to the city are home to frequent landslides, resulting in a typical change of landscape along the Black Sea. Due to the fluctuating slopes of land, city planners are responsible for monitoring the stability of such areas, and for preserving potentially threatened building and other structures of the city above sea level near water. Also a potential danger to the infrastructure and architecture of the city is the presence of multiple openings underground. These cavities can cause buildings to collapse, resulting in a loss of money and business.

Up until the early 1940s the city had a large Jewish population. As the result of mass deportation to extermination camps during the Second World War, the city's Jewish population declined considerably. Since the 1970s, the majority of the remaining Jewish population emigrated to Israel and other countries, shrinking the Jewish community.\nThrough most of the 19th century and until the mid-20th century, the largest ethnic group in Odesa was Russians, with the second largest ethnic group being Jews.The peculiarity of the ethnic composition of the modern population of the city of Odesa is its ethnic diversity. According to the 2001 Ukrainian census, Ukrainians made up 62% of the Odesa's inhabitants, Russians 29%, Bulgarians 6.1%, Moldovans 5%, Gagauz 1.1%, Jews 0.6%, Belarusians 0.5%, Armenians 0.3%, Roma 0.2%, Poles, Germans, Georgians, Azerbaijanis, Tartars, Greeks, Albanians and Arabs each 0.1%, and 1.9% were people of other nationalities.A 2015 study by the International Republican Institute found that 68% of Odesa's population were ethnic Ukrainians, and 25% were ethnic Russians.", "start_char_idx": 28913, "end_char_idx": 31859, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ff417e9-81fa-4f6a-b63e-1ca0e18dfabc": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ff417e9-81fa-4f6a-b63e-1ca0e18dfabc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Odisha.txt", "file_name": "Odisha.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 64173, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0e65315f-9f60-4250-b9b7-d72121e2ddde", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Odisha.txt", "file_name": "Odisha.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 64173, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "c19afb14d80814d54a8c7dbe917ac144b1354da27cb6e3121195a8071f5247af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b072f672-d61b-4773-9faa-56c366f3d25c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Odisha.txt", "file_name": "Odisha.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 64173, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "496dd40b0007af6aa516f088ee8383ed871e8635da0223cba9bb1e6ceddec9a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "31a460b1-b247-415d-9aff-6f955d1fa86e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c280f623071348ab87d427eb5e1fdc3c1b201ffc6ede260181d55a45f7aba42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Language ===\nDistribution of the population of the city of Odesa by native language according to the 2001 census:\nAccording to the Seventh Annual Ukrainian Municipal Survey, 96% of the residents of Odesa spoke some Russian at home and 29% spoke some Ukrainian at home (overlap due to a lot of people speaking both languages). Ukrainian is gaining in popularity: in 2021, the share of residents speaking some Ukrainian at home has increased almost 5 times from 6% in 2015 to 29% in 2021.According to a survey conducted by the International Republican Institute in April\u2013May 2023, 53% of the city's population has higher or incomplete higher education, 16% spoke Ukrainian at home and 80% spoke Russian.58% of Odesa Oblast's population consider Ukrainian their native language, and 39% of population in Ukraine's South who consider Ukrainian their native language mostly speak Russian at home.According to a sociological survey conducted by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation from 10 to 21 July 2023 in Odesa Oblast, the share of respondents who speak Ukrainian at home has increased to 42% (from 26% in 2021), while the share of those who speak Russian at home has dropped to 54%.\n\n\n== Government and administrative divisions ==\nOdesa is the administrative centre of Odesa Raion and Odesa Oblast, and it is the only constituent of Odesa urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine.The city of Odesa is governed by a mayor and city council which work cooperatively to ensure the smooth-running of the city and procure its municipal bylaws. The city's budget is also controlled by the administration.\nThe mayoralty plays the role of the executive in the city's municipal administration. Above all comes the mayor, who is elected, by the city's electorate, for five years in a direct election. 2015 Mayoral election of Odesa Hennadii Trukhanov was reelected in the first round of the election with 52,9% of the vote. Trukhanov was again reelected in the second round of the 2020 Mayoral election of Odesa when 54.28% of the voters voted for him.There are five deputy mayors, each of which is responsible for a certain particular part of the city's public policy.\n\nThe City Council of the city makes up the administration's legislative branch, thus effectively making it a city 'parliament' or rada. The municipal council is made up of 120 elected members, who are each elected to represent a certain district of the city for a four-year term. The current council is the fifth in the city's modern history, and was elected in January 2011. In the regular meetings of the municipal council, problems facing the city are discussed, and annually the city's budget is drawn up. The council has seventeen standing commissions which play an important role in controlling the finances and trading practices of the city and its merchants.\nThe territory of Odesa is divided into four administrative raions (districts):\n\nKyivskyi Raion\nKhadzhybeiskyi Raion\nPrymorskyi Raion\nPeresypskyi RaionIn addition, every raion has its own administration, subordinate to the Odesa City council, and with limited responsibilities.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nMany of Odesa's buildings have, rather uniquely for a Ukrainian city, been influenced by the Mediterranean style of classical architecture.", "start_char_idx": 31862, "end_char_idx": 35146, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "31a460b1-b247-415d-9aff-6f955d1fa86e": {"__data__": {"id_": "31a460b1-b247-415d-9aff-6f955d1fa86e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Odisha.txt", "file_name": "Odisha.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 64173, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0e65315f-9f60-4250-b9b7-d72121e2ddde", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Odisha.txt", "file_name": "Odisha.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 64173, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "c19afb14d80814d54a8c7dbe917ac144b1354da27cb6e3121195a8071f5247af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2ff417e9-81fa-4f6a-b63e-1ca0e18dfabc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Odisha.txt", "file_name": "Odisha.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 64173, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "fe86e9b701326ce9c7988724537ef92905e0f6ede27a13f73c084a0e835cd36e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "90d2f8e2-c045-4b00-a9b9-2ad2831f2b1c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "510d11a766d1c7e4868e5945db225a3ff41e011faf5e9d14d879bb9fe6748f00", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Cityscape ==\n\nMany of Odesa's buildings have, rather uniquely for a Ukrainian city, been influenced by the Mediterranean style of classical architecture. This is particularly noticeable in buildings built by architects such as the Italian Francesco Boffo, who in the early 19th-century built a palace and colonnade for the Governor of Odesa, Prince Mikhail Vorontsov, the Potocki Palace and many other public buildings.\nIn 1887 one of the city's most well known architectural monuments was completed \u2013 the theatre, which still hosts a range of performances to this day; it is widely regarded as one of the world's finest opera houses. The first opera house was opened in 1810 and destroyed by fire in 1873. The modern building was constructed by Fellner and Helmer in neo-baroque; its luxurious hall was built in the rococo style. It is said that thanks to its unique acoustics, even a whisper from the stage can be heard in any part of the hall. The theatre was projected along the lines of Dresden's Semperoper built in 1878, with its nontraditional foyer following the curvatures of the auditorium; the building's most recent renovation was completed in 2007.Odesa's most iconic symbol, the Potemkin Stairs, is a vast staircase that conjures an illusion so that those at the top only see a series of large steps, while at the bottom all the steps appear to merge into one pyramid-shaped mass. The original 200 steps (now reduced to 192) were designed by Italian architect Francesco Boffo and built between 1837 and 1841. The steps were made famous by Sergei Eisenstein in his film, Battleship Potemkin.\nMost of the city's 19th-century houses were built of limestone mined nearby. Abandoned mines were later used and broadened by local smugglers. This created a gigantic, complicated labyrinth of tunnels beneath Odesa, known as the Odesa catacombs. During World War II, the catacombs served as a hiding place for partisans and natural shelter for civilians, who were escaping airplane bombing.\nDerybasivska Street, an attractive pedestrian avenue named after Jos\u00e9 de Ribas, the Neapolitan-born founder of Odesa and decorated Russian Navy Admiral from the Russo-Turkish War, is famous by its unique character and architecture. During the summer it is common to find large crowds of people leisurely sitting and talking on the outdoor terraces of numerous caf\u00e9s, bars and restaurants, or simply enjoying a walk along the cobblestone street, which is not open to vehicular traffic and is kept shaded by the linden trees which line its route. A similar streetscape can also be found in that of Prymorsky Bulvar, a grand thoroughfare which runs along the edge of the plateau upon which the city is situated, and where many of the city's most imposing buildings are to be found.\nAs one of the biggest on the Black Sea, Odesa's port is busy all year round. The Odesa Seaport is located on an artificial stretch of the Black Sea coast, along with the north-western part of the Gulf of Odesa. The total shoreline length of Odesa's seaport is around 7.23 kilometres (4.49 mi). The port, which includes an oil refinery, container handling facility, passenger area and numerous areas for handling dry cargo, is lucky in that its work does not depend on seasonal weather; the harbour itself is defended from the elements by breakwaters.", "start_char_idx": 34990, "end_char_idx": 38319, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90d2f8e2-c045-4b00-a9b9-2ad2831f2b1c": {"__data__": {"id_": "90d2f8e2-c045-4b00-a9b9-2ad2831f2b1c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Odisha.txt", "file_name": "Odisha.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 64173, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0e65315f-9f60-4250-b9b7-d72121e2ddde", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Odisha.txt", "file_name": "Odisha.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 64173, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "c19afb14d80814d54a8c7dbe917ac144b1354da27cb6e3121195a8071f5247af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "31a460b1-b247-415d-9aff-6f955d1fa86e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Odisha.txt", "file_name": "Odisha.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 64173, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "dc81eb5bc4a401486f90aa5cd7e10243044c011bb0a2a72837794190fde5b433", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e83a5e81-2cf8-44a3-acdf-d02cee54c7d8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3a73f9f2cf99305e521830035a7d110b1ee450b9caade4854fff6704184695a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The total shoreline length of Odesa's seaport is around 7.23 kilometres (4.49 mi).

The city is also home to a university botanical garden, which recently celebrated its 200th anniversary, and a number of other smaller gardens.\nThe City Garden, or Gorodskoy Sad, is perhaps the most famous of Odesa's gardens. Laid out in 1803 by Felix De Ribas (brother of the founder of Odesa, Jos\u00e9 de Ribas) on a plot of urban land he owned, the garden is located right in the heart of the city. When Felix decided that he was no longer able to provide enough money for the garden's upkeep, he decided to present it to the people of Odesa in 1806.The garden is home to a bandstand and is the traditional location for outdoor theater in the summertime. Numerous sculptures can also be found within the grounds, as well as a musical fountain, the waters of which are computer controlled to coordinate with the musical melody being played.\nOdesa's largest park, Shevchenko Park (previously Alexander Park), was founded in 1875, during a visit to the city by Emperor Alexander II. The park covers an area of around 700 by 900 metres (2,300 by 3,000 feet) and is located near the centre of the city, on the side closest to the sea. Within the park there are a variety of cultural and entertainment facilities, and wide pedestrian avenues.\nIn the center of the park is the local top-flight football team's Chornomorets Stadium, the Alexander Column and municipal observatory. The Baryatinsky Bulvar is popular for its route, which starts at the park's gate before winding its way along the edge of the coastal plateau. There are a number of monuments and memorials in the park, one of which is dedicated to the park's namesake, the Ukrainian national poet Taras Shevchenko.", "start_char_idx": 37980, "end_char_idx": 40582, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e83a5e81-2cf8-44a3-acdf-d02cee54c7d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "e83a5e81-2cf8-44a3-acdf-d02cee54c7d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Odisha.txt", "file_name": "Odisha.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 64173, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0e65315f-9f60-4250-b9b7-d72121e2ddde", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Odisha.txt", "file_name": "Odisha.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 64173, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "c19afb14d80814d54a8c7dbe917ac144b1354da27cb6e3121195a8071f5247af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "90d2f8e2-c045-4b00-a9b9-2ad2831f2b1c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Odisha.txt", "file_name": "Odisha.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 64173, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "c2a437f86f5cab065ecffe0d3e6e1883e820078d9185af6b3c99bd07ded45e18", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ccf50acc-54d4-4a68-aa95-f7295ba7b60d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0ac56d0890140a6f038b397774c95530de613ba188f4c885a9ca3785c4428eb5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Education ==\nOdesa is home to several universities and other institutions of higher education.

Odesa has produced many writers, including Isaac Babel, whose series of short stories, Odessa Tales, are set in the city. Other Odesans are the duo Ilf and Petrov\u2014authors of The Twelve Chairs, and Yuri Olesha, author of \"The Three Fat Men\". Vera Inber, a poet and writer, as well as the poet and journalist Margarita Aliger, were both born in Odesa. The Italian writer, Slavist and anti-fascist dissident Leone Ginzburg was born in Odesa into a Jewish family, and then went to Italy where he grew up and lived.\nOne of the most prominent pre-war Soviet writers, Valentin Kataev, was born here and began his writing career as early as high school (gymnasia). Before moving to Moscow in 1922, he made quite a few acquaintances here, including Yury Olesha and Ilya Ilf (Ilf's co-author Petrov was in fact Kataev's brother, Petrov being his pen-name). Kataev became a benefactor for these young authors, who would become some of the most talented and popular Russian writers of this period. In 1955 Kataev became the first chief editor of the Youth (Russian: \u042e\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c, Yunost'), one of the leading literature magazines of the Ottepel of the 1950s and 1960s.These authors and comedians played a great role in establishing the \"Odesa myth\" in the Soviet Union. Odesans were and are viewed in the ethnic stereotype as sharp-witted, street-wise and eternally optimistic. These qualities are reflected in the \"Odesa dialect\", which borrows chiefly from the characteristic speech of the Odesan Jews, and is enriched by a plethora of influences common for the port city.The \"Odesite speech\" became a staple of the \"Soviet Jew\" depicted in a multitude of jokes and comedy acts, in which a Jewish adherent served as a wise and subtle dissenter and opportunist, always pursuing his own well-being, but unwittingly pointing out the flaws and absurdities of the Soviet regime. The Odesan Jew in the jokes always \"came out clean\" and was, in the end, a lovable character \u2013 unlike some of other jocular nation stereotypes such as The Chukcha, The Ukrainian, The Estonian or The American.\n\n\n=== Resorts and health care ===\nOdesa is a popular tourist destination, with many therapeutic resorts in and around the city. The city's Filatov Institute of Eye Diseases & Tissue Therapy is one of the world's leading ophthalmology clinics.\n\n\n=== Celebrations and holidays ===\n\nApril Fools' Day, held annually on 1 April, is one of the most celebrated festivals in the city. Practical joking is a central theme throughout, and Odesans dress in unique, colorful attire to express their spontaneous and comedic selves. The tradition has been celebrated since the early 1970s, when the humor of Ukraine's citizens were drawn to television and the media, further developing into a mass festival. Large amounts of money are made from the festivities, supporting Odesa's local entertainers and shops.", "start_char_idx": 45564, "end_char_idx": 48590, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4111425-9a5d-486d-93c8-0ae83d583866": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4111425-9a5d-486d-93c8-0ae83d583866", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Odisha.txt", "file_name": "Odisha.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 64173, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0e65315f-9f60-4250-b9b7-d72121e2ddde", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Odisha.txt", "file_name": "Odisha.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 64173, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "c19afb14d80814d54a8c7dbe917ac144b1354da27cb6e3121195a8071f5247af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c68e843f-1d69-4b42-800d-ebaed6043202", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Odisha.txt", "file_name": "Odisha.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 64173, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "08d27eda89fb8a5ac0e5563d7e034a8d00dc81f1b33266a3993ff544e9f76767", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "24feeddf-5c96-4fcc-b4a8-7ac22801e047", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca13d18d82095b8b01bbebc14d7324eea01096c5e96fd934957c5d2094881737", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Notable Odesans ===\nPyotr Schmidt (1867\u20131906) (better known as \"Lieutenant Schmidt\"), one of the leaders of the Sevastopol uprising, was born in Odesa.\nZe'ev Jabotinsky (1880\u20131940), was born in Odesa, and largely developed his version of Zionism there in the early 1920s.

The nearly ice-free port lies near the mouths of the Dnieper, the Southern Bug, the Dniester and the Danube rivers, which provide good links to the hinterland.\nDuring the Soviet period (until 1991) the city functioned as the USSR's largest trading port; it continues in a similar role as independent Ukraine's busiest international port. The port complex contains an oil and gas transfer and storage facility, a cargo-handling area and a large passenger port. In 2007 the Port of Odesa handled 31,368,000 tonnes of cargo.The port of Odesa is one of the Ukrainian Navy's most important bases on the Black Sea. Rail transport is an important sector of the economy in Odesa \u2013 largely due to the role it plays in delivering goods and imports to and from the city's port. The Container Terminal Odesa (CTO) in the port is the largest container terminal in Ukraine. It has been operated by the Hamburg-based HHLA Group since 2001 and, in addition to containers, also handles bulk goods, general cargo and project cargo. This means that Odesa is networked with the ports of Hamburg, Muuga and Trieste via the logistics group HHLA.\nIndustrial enterprises located in and around the city include those dedicated to fuel refinement, machine building, metallurgy, and other types of light industry such as food preparation, timber plants and chemical industry. Agriculture is a relatively important sector in the territories surrounding the city. The Seventh-Kilometer Market is a major commercial complex on the outskirts of the city where private traders now operate one of the largest market complexes in Eastern Europe. The market has roughly 6,000 traders and an estimated 150,000 customers per day.\nDaily sales, according to the Ukrainian periodical Dzerkalo Tyzhnia, were believed to be as high as US$20 million in 2004. With a staff of 1,200 (mostly guards and janitors), the market is also the region's largest employer. It is owned by local land and agriculture tycoon Viktor A. Dobrianskyi and three partners of his. Tavria-V is the most popular retail chain in Odesa. Key areas of business include: retail, wholesale, catering, production, construction and development, private label. Consumer recognition is mainly attributed to the high level of service and the quality of services. Tavria-V is the biggest private company and the biggest tax payer.\n\nDeribasivska Street is one of the city's most important commercial streets, hosting many of the city's boutiques and higher-end shops. In addition to this there are a number of large commercial shopping centres in the city. The 19th-century shopping gallery Passage was, for a long time, the city's most upscale shopping district, and remains to this day an important landmark of Odesa.\nThe tourism sector is of great importance to Odesa, which is currently the second most-visited Ukrainian city. In 2003 this sector recorded a total revenue of \u20b4189.2 million. Other sectors of the city's economy include the banking sector: the city hosts a branch of the National Bank of Ukraine.

Before the fall of the Soviet Union, the Port of Odesa harbored the major Soviet cruise line Black Sea Shipping Company.\nPassenger ships and ferries connect Odesa with Istanbul, Haifa and Varna, whilst river cruises can occasionally be booked for travel up the Dnieper River to cities such as Kherson, Dnipro and Kyiv.", "start_char_idx": 54473, "end_char_idx": 56831, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38315917-ab65-427c-8542-8e5314cf23c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "38315917-ab65-427c-8542-8e5314cf23c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Odisha.txt", "file_name": "Odisha.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 64173, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0e65315f-9f60-4250-b9b7-d72121e2ddde", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Odisha.txt", "file_name": "Odisha.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 64173, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "c19afb14d80814d54a8c7dbe917ac144b1354da27cb6e3121195a8071f5247af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f6e32c3-ffd5-42a5-8250-8da4d5bd3e2a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Odisha.txt", "file_name": "Odisha.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 64173, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "2cd16dba0ab7818407e17883d5b28f138c7a99ec2296250cc08512010ebd4811", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "de3e954d-35c6-42e2-89e9-f376363c074f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "166733f6b01b766e58a8e3bfe85e023d3f646c2ad2c040e2b88093caa1c7b828", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Roads and automotive transport ===\nThe first car in the Russian Empire, a Mercedes-Benz belonging to V. Navrotsky, came to Odesa from France in 1891. He was a popular city publisher of the newspaper Odesskii listok (\"Odesa leaf\").\nOdesa is linked to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, by the M05 Highway, a high quality multi-lane road which is set to be re-designated, after further reconstructive works, as an 'Avtomagistral' (motorway) in the near future. Other routes of national significance, passing through Odesa, include the M16 Highway to Moldova, M15 to Izmail and Romania, and the M14 which runs from Odesa, through Mykolaiv and Kherson to Ukraine's eastern border with Russia. The M14 is of particular importance to Odesa's maritime and shipbuilding industries as it links the city with Ukraine's other large deep water port Mariupol which is located in the south east of the country.\nOdesa also has a well-developed system of inter-urban municipal roads and minor beltways. However, the city is still lacking an extra-urban bypass for transit traffic which does not wish to proceed through the city centre.\nIntercity bus services are available from Odesa to many cities in Russia (Moscow, Rostov-on-Don, Krasnodar, Pyatigorsk), Germany (Berlin, Hamburg and Munich), Greece (Thessaloniki and Athens), Bulgaria (Varna and Sofia) and several cities of Ukraine and Europe.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\nOdesa is served by a number of railway stations and halts, the largest of which is Odesa Holovna (Main Station). From this station services connect Odesa with Warsaw, Prague, Bratislava, Vienna, Berlin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, the cities of Ukraine and many other cities of the former USSR. The city's first railway station was opened in the 1880s. During the Second World War, the iconic building of the main station, which had long been considered to be one of the Russian Empire's premier stations, was destroyed through enemy action.\nIn 1952 the station was rebuilt to the designs of A Chuprina.

The first metre gauge steam tramway line ran from Railway Station to Great Fontaine and the second one to Hadzhi Bey Liman. These routes were both operated by the same Belgian company. Electric tramway started to operate on 22 August 1907. Trams were imported from Germany.The city's public transit system is currently made up of trams, trolleybuses, buses and fixed-route taxis (marshrutkas). Odesa also has a cable car to Vidrada Beach, and recreational ferry service. There are two routes of public transport which connect Odesa Airport with the city center: trolley-bus No.14 and marshrutka No.117.One additional mode of transport in Odesa is the Potemkin Stairs funicular railway, which runs between the city's Primorsky Bulvar and the sea terminal, has been in service since 1902. In 1998, after many years of neglect, the city decided to raise funds for a replacement track and cars. This project was delayed on multiple occasions but was finally completed eight years later in 2005. The funicular has now become as much a part of historic Odesa as the staircase to which it runs parallel.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nOdesa International Airport, which is located to the south-west of the city centre, is served by a number of airlines. The airport is also often used by citizens of neighbouring countries for whom Odesa is the nearest large city and who can travel visa-free to Ukraine.\nTransit flights from the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East to Odesa are offered by Ukraine International Airlines through their hub at Kyiv's Boryspil International Airport.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nThe most popular sport in Odesa is football. The main professional football club in the city is FC Chornomorets Odesa, who play in the Ukrainian Premier League. Chornomorets play their home games at the Chornomorets Stadium, an elite-class stadium which has a maximum capacity of 34,164. The second football team in Odesa is FC Odesa.Basketball is also a prominent sport in Odesa, with BC Odesa representing the city in the Ukrainian Basketball League, the highest tier basketball league in Ukraine.

The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea mentions a marketplace named Poduke or Poduka (ch 60). G. W. B. Huntingford suggested this might be a site about 2 miles from the modern Puducherry, which was possibly the location of Arikamedu (now part of Ariyankuppam). Huntingford noted that Roman pottery was found at Arikamedu in 1937. In addition, archaeological excavations between 1944 and 1949 showed that it was \"a trading station to which goods of Roman manufacture were imported during the first half of the 1st century\" Subsequent investigation by Vimala Begley from 1989 to 1992 modified this assessment, and now place the period of occupation from the third or second century BCE to the eighth century CE.In 1674, the municipality of Pondicherry (Pondich\u00e9ry) became a colony in the French colonial empire. Together with Chandernagor (already French since 1673), Mah\u00e9 (since 1721), Yanam (Yanaon) (since 1723), Karaikal (Karikal) (since 1739) and Masulipatam (1760), it formed the colony of French India, under a single French governor in Pondicherry, although French rule over one or more of these enclaves was repeatedly interrupted by British occupations. The territories of French India were completely transferred to the Republic of India de facto on 1 November 1954, and de jure on 16 August 1962, when French India ceased to exist, becoming the present Indian union territory of Pondicherry, combining four coastal enclaves.

Meanwhile, with effect from 1 July 1963, the State of Pondicherry officially became the Union Territory of Pondicherry and after 31 August 1964 it came under the control of the Ministry of Home Affairs.:\u200a37\u200aUntil 2016, the de jure transfer day (i.e. 16 August) was a public holiday with no official celebrations taking place. In 2016, Lt. Governor of Puducherry, Kiran Bedi, made it a holiday as \"De Jure Transfer Day.\"\nSince 2010, de facto transfer day (i.e. 1 November) has been celebrated as Liberation day throughout Puducherry. In 2014, Liberation day was declared as a public Holiday. This initiative was taken shortly after the NDA government came to power in 2014 and newly appointed Lt. Governor A. K.

Puducherry and Karaikal have the largest areas and population, and are both enclaves of Tamil Nadu. Yanam and Mah\u00e9 are enclaves of Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, respectively. Its population, as per the 2011 Census, is 1,394,467. Puducherry is the smallest union territory in terms of sea coastline with 30.6 km length.\nSome of Puducherry's regions are themselves amalgamations of non-contiguous enclaves, often called \"pockets\" in India. The Puducherry region is made of 11 such pockets, some of which are very small and entirely surrounded by the territory of Tamil Nadu. Mah\u00e9 region is made up of three pockets. This unusual geography is a legacy of the colonial period with Puducherry retaining the borders of former French India.\nAll four regions of Puducherry are located in the coastal region. Five rivers in Puducherry district, seven in Karaikal district, two in Mah\u00e9 district and one in Yanam district drain into the sea, but none originates within the territory.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nPuducherry district is an enclave of Tamil Nadu.\nKaraikal district is an enclave of Tamil Nadu.\nMah\u00e9 district is an enclave of Kerala.\nYanam district is an enclave of Andhra Pradesh.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nHinduism is the major religion, adhered to by 87.3% of the population. Other religions practiced in the territory include Christianity (6.3%) and Islam (6.1%).\n\n\n== Government and administration ==\n\nPuducherry is a union territory of India rather than a state, which implies that governance and administration fall directly under federal authority. It is one of three union territories (with the National Capital Territory of Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir) entitled by a special constitutional amendment to an elected legislative assembly and cabinet of ministers, thereby conveying partial statehood. There has been some interest by the territory's government in receiving full statehood, but budgetary issues remain a consideration. Also, Mahe and Yanam may oppose such a change of status.The central government is represented by the Lieutenant Governor, who resides at the Raj Nivas (Le Palais du Gouverneur) at the Park, the former palace of the French governor. The central government is more directly involved in the territory's financial well-being unlike states, which have a central grant that they administer.

There are also speakers of Telugu (6.0%), Malayalam (3.8%) and Urdu (0.7%). The official languages of Puducherry are French, Tamil, Telugu (in Yanam), Malayalam (in Mahe) and English.

The 1963 act allowed provision for inclusion of more official languages. Two years later, new official languages were recognised by The Pondicherry Official Language Act, 1965  which makes no mention of French (but also not officially denying it) implying the implicit continuation of its official language status. The same act stated that the Tamil language shall be the language to be used for all or any of the official purposes of the Union territory and the same official recognition is given for English. The same act also recognized officially Malayalam and Telugu in the Mah\u00e9 and Yanam districts respectively.The widespread anti-Hindi agitations in the mid-1960s in South India would have prompted for inclusion of all the languages suggested in the 1963 assembly resolution except Hindi in the list of official languages of Puducherry.

It is specifically located in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent, comprising areas of modern-day eastern-Pakistan and northwestern-India. Punjab's major cities are Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Multan, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Sialkot, Chandigarh, Shimla, Jalandhar, Patiala, Gurugram, and Bahawalpur.\nPunjab grew out of the settlements along the five rivers, which served as an important route to the Near East as early as the ancient Indus Valley civilization, dating back to 3000 BCE, and had numerous migrations by the Indo-Aryan peoples. Agriculture has been the major economic feature of the Punjab and has therefore formed the foundation of Punjabi culture, with one's social status being determined by land ownership. The Punjab emerged as an important agricultural region, especially following the Green Revolution during the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, and has been described as the \"breadbasket of both India and Pakistan.\"Punjab's history is a tapestry of conflict, marked by the rise of indigenous dynasties and empires. Following Alexander the Great's invasion in the 4th century BCE, Chandragupta Maurya allied with Punjabi republics to establish the Maurya Empire. Successive reigns of the Indo-Greek Kingdom, Kushan Empire, and Indo-Scythians followed, but were ultimately defeated by Eastern Punjab Janapadas such as the Yaudheya, Trigarta Kingdom, Audumbaras, Arjunayanas, and Kuninda Kingdom. In the 5th and 6th centuries CE, Punjab faced devastating Hunnic invasions, yet the Vardhana dynasty emerged triumphant, ruling over Northern India. The 8th century CE witnessed the Hindu Shahis rise, known for defeating the Saffarid dynasty and the Samanid Empire. Concurrently, the Tomara dynasty and Katoch Dynasty controlled eastern Punjab, resisting Ghaznavid invasions. Islam took hold in Western Punjab under Ghaznavid rule. The Delhi Sultanate then succeeded the Ghaznavids in which the Tughlaq dynasty and Sayyid dynasty Sultans are described as Punjabi origin. The 15th century saw the emergence of the Langah Sultanate in south Punjab, acclaimed for its victory over the Lodi dynasty. After the Mughal Empire's decline in the 18th century, Punjab experienced a period of anarchy. In 1799 CE, the Sikh Empire established its rule, undertaking conquests into Kashmir and Durrani Empire held territories, shaping the diverse and complex history of Punjab.\nThe boundaries of the region are ill-defined and focus on historical accounts and thus the geographical definition of the term \"Punjab\" has changed over time.

In the 16th century Mughal Empire the Punjab region was divided into three, with the Lahore Subah in the west, the Delhi Subah in the east and the Multan Subah in the south. In British India, until the Partition of India in 1947, the Punjab Province encompassed the present-day Indian states and union territories of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, and Delhi, and the Pakistani regions of Punjab, and Islamabad Capital Territory.\nThe predominant ethnolinguistic group of the Punjab region are the Punjabi people, who speak the Indo-Aryan Punjabi language. Punjabi Muslims are the majority in West Punjab (Pakistan), while Punjabi Sikhs are the majority in East Punjab (India). Other religious groups include Hinduism, Christianity, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, and Ravidassia.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAlthough the name Punjab is of Persian origin, its two parts (\u067e\u0646\u062c, panj, 'five' and \u0622\u0628, \u0101b, 'water') are cognates of the Sanskrit words \u092a\u091e\u094d\u200d\u091a, pa\u00f1ca, 'five' and \u0905\u092a\u094d, \u00e1p, 'water', of the same meaning. The word pa\u00f1j\u0101b thus means \"The Land of Five Waters\", referring to the rivers Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Sutlej, and Beas. All are tributaries of the Indus River, the Sutlej being the largest. References to a land of five rivers may be found in the Mahabharata, which calls one of the regions in ancient Bharat Panchanada (Sanskrit: \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u0928\u0926, romanized: pa\u00f1ca-nada, lit.\u2009'five rivers'). Persian place names are very common in Northwest India and Pakistan. The ancient Greeks referred to the region as Pentapotam\u00eda (Greek: \u03a0\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1), which has the same meaning as the Persian word.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient period ===\nThe Punjab region is noted as the site of one of the earliest urban societies, the Indus Valley Civilization that flourished from about 3000 BCE and declined rapidly 1,000 years later, following the Indo-Aryan migrations that overran the region in waves between 1500 BCE and 500 BCE. Frequent intertribal wars stimulated the growth of larger groupings ruled by chieftains and kings, who ruled local kingdoms known as Mahajanapadas. The rise of kingdoms and dynasties in the Punjab is chronicled in the ancient Hindu epics, particularly the Mahabharata. The epic battles described in the Mahabharata are chronicled as being fought in what is now the state of Haryana and historic Punjab. The Gandharas, Kambojas, Trigartas, Andhra, Pauravas, Bahlikas (Bactrian settlers of the Punjab), Yaudheyas, and others sided with the Kauravas in the great battle fought at Kurukshetra. According to Fauja Singh and L. M. Joshi: \"There is no doubt that the Kambojas, Daradas, Kaikayas, Andhra, Pauravas, Yaudheyas, Malavas, Saindhavas, and Kurus had jointly contributed to the heroic tradition and composite culture of ancient Punjab.\"", "start_char_idx": 2572, "end_char_idx": 5488, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6b31be7-ddd0-441a-bc15-8940f1023a3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c6b31be7-ddd0-441a-bc15-8940f1023a3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Punjab.txt", "file_name": "Punjab.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38429, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fa98e5ec-96ff-4b56-820e-f0c54a33364d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Punjab.txt", "file_name": "Punjab.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38429, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "4790fd0fea88c28631f278920bac34472ce27ef477668533156883b9f16947eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7c486ff3-b6ef-4194-902a-d5c7b0454620", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Punjab.txt", "file_name": "Punjab.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38429, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "ec0718b76a23f56a7d8dcd3d88b62119cfb5498728c4a2dfe7222c6135495f0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e704873b-f0ec-4d1a-9699-ab81a6479ac4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "851ab10185b67d5b0769d3609a5b07f68d44bc8e1e3cfe88da3bf53e16a5afe3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "==== Invasions of Alexander the Great (c. 4th century BCE) ====\nThe earliest known notable local king of this region was known as King Porus, who fought the famous Battle of the Hydaspes against Alexander the Great. His kingdom spanned between rivers Hydaspes (Jhelum) and Acesines (Chenab); Strabo had held the territory to contain almost 300 cities. He (alongside Abisares) had a hostile relationship with the Kingdom of Taxila which was ruled by his extended family. When the armies of Alexander crossed Indus in its eastward migration, probably in Udabhandapura, he was greeted by the-then ruler of Taxila, Omphis. Omphis had hoped to force both Porus and Abisares into submission leveraging the might of Alexander's forces and diplomatic missions were mounted, but while Abisares accepted the submission, Porus refused. This led Alexander to seek for a face-off with Porus. Thus began the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC; the exact site remains unknown. The battle is thought to be resulted in a decisive Greek victory; however, A. B. Bosworth warns against an uncritical reading of Greek sources who were obviously exaggerative.Alexander later founded two cities\u2014Nicaea at the site of victory and Bucephalous at the battle-ground, in memory of his horse, who died soon after the battle. Later, tetradrachms would be minted depicting Alexander on horseback, armed with a sarissa and attacking a pair of Indians on an elephant. Porus refused to surrender and wandered about atop an elephant, until he was wounded and his force routed. When asked by Alexander how he wished to be treated, Porus replied \"Treat me as a king would treat another king\". Despite the apparently one-sided results, Alexander was impressed by Porus and chose to not depose him. Not only was his territory reinstated but also expanded with Alexander's forces annexing the territories of Glausaes, who ruled to the northeast of Porus' kingdom.After Alexander's death in 323 BCE, Perdiccas became the regent of his empire, and after Perdiccas's murder in 321 BCE, Antipater became the new regent. According to Diodorus, Antipater recognized Porus's authority over the territories along the Indus River. However, Eudemus, who had served as Alexander's satrap in the Punjab region, treacherously killed Porus.", "start_char_idx": 5491, "end_char_idx": 7775, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e704873b-f0ec-4d1a-9699-ab81a6479ac4": {"__data__": {"id_": "e704873b-f0ec-4d1a-9699-ab81a6479ac4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Punjab.txt", "file_name": "Punjab.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38429, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fa98e5ec-96ff-4b56-820e-f0c54a33364d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Punjab.txt", "file_name": "Punjab.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38429, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "4790fd0fea88c28631f278920bac34472ce27ef477668533156883b9f16947eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c6b31be7-ddd0-441a-bc15-8940f1023a3c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Punjab.txt", "file_name": "Punjab.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38429, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "a1910344e87b5ff4f90b285bab813315c555e1785dd0cbcc6a16f5b621608572", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "be36474d-43a4-4b85-bddb-eb8059412e6e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "786b0ea18822ca654142ff670481b0be8122aefd822dffa2ccc44df452540e5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "==== Mauryan Empire (c. 320\u2013180 BCE) ====\nChandragupta Maurya, with the aid of Kautilya, had established his empire around 320 BCE. The early life of Chandragupta Maurya is not clear. Kautilya enrolled the young Chandragupta in the university at Taxila to educate him in the arts, sciences, logic, mathematics, warfare, and administration. Megasthenes' account, as it has survived in Greek texts that quote him, states that Alexander the Great and Chandragupta met, which if true would mean his rule started earlier than 321 BCE. As Alexander never crossed the Beas river, so his territory probably lied in Punjab region. He has also been variously identified with Shashigupta (who has same etymology as of Chandragupta) of Paropamisadae (western Punjab) on the account of same life events. With the help of the small Janapadas of Punjab, he had gone on to conquer much of the North West Indian subcontinent. He then defeated the Nanda rulers in Pataliputra to capture the throne. Chandragupta Maurya fought Alexander's successor in the east, Seleucus when the latter invaded. In a peace treaty, Seleucus ceded all territories west of the Indus and offered a marriage, including a portion of Bactria, while Chandragupta granted Seleucus 500 elephants. The chief of the Mauryan military was also always a Yaudheyan warrior according to the Bijaygadh Pillar inscription, which states that the Yaudheyas elected their own chief who also served as the general for the Mauryans. The Mauryan military was also made up vastly of men from the Punjab Janapadas.Chandragupta's rule was very well organised. The Mauryans had an autocratic and centralised administration system, aided by a council of ministers, and also a well-established espionage system. Much of Chandragupta's success is attributed to Chanakya, the author of the Arthashastra. According to Buddhist sources Chanakya was native of the Punjab who resided in Taxila. Much of the Mauryan rule had a strong bureaucracy that had regulated tax collection, trade and commerce, industrial activities, mining, statistics and data, maintenance of public places, and upkeep of temples.\n\n\n=== Medieval period ===\n\n\n==== Hindu Shahis (c. 820\u20131030 CE) ====\nIn the 9th century, the Hindu Shahi dynasty originating from the region of Oddiyana, replaced the Taank kingdom, ruling Western Punjab along with eastern Afghanistan. The tribe of the Gakhars/Khokhars, formed a large part of the Hindu Shahi army according to the Persian historian Firishta. The most notable rulers of the empire were Lalliya, Bhimadeva and Jayapala who were accredited for military victories.\nLalliya had reclaimed the territory at and around Kabul between 879 and 901 CE after it had been lost under his predecessor to the Saffarid dynasty. He was described as a fearsome Shahi.

His first attempt was a failure. Four months later, Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq sent large army reinforcements for his son asking him to attempt plundering Arangal and Tilang again. This time Jauna Khan succeeded and Arangal fell, it was renamed to Sultanpur, and all plundered wealth, state treasury and captives were transferred from the captured kingdom to the Delhi Sultanate.The Muslim aristocracy in Lukhnauti (Bengal) invited Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq to extend his coup and expand eastwards into Bengal by attacking Shamsuddin Firoz Shah, which he did over 1324\u20131325 AD, after placing Delhi under control of his son Ulugh Khan, and then leading his army to Lukhnauti. Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq succeeded in this campaign.\nAfter his father's death in 1325 CE, Muhammad bin Tughlaq assumed power and his rule saw the empire expand to most of the Indian subcontinent, its peak in terms of geographical reach. He attacked and plundered Malwa, Gujarat, Lakhnauti, Chittagong, Mithila and many other regions in India. His distant campaigns were expensive, although each raid and attack on non-Muslim kingdoms brought new looted wealth and ransom payments from captured people. The extended empire was difficult to retain, and rebellions became commonplace all over the Indian subcontinent. Muhammad bin Tughlaq died in March 1351 while trying to chase and punish people for rebellion and their refusal to pay taxes in Sindh and Gujarat.After Muhammad bin Tughlaq's death, the Tughlaq empire was in a state of disarray with many regions assuming independence; it was at this point that Firuz Shah Tughlaq, Ghazi Malik's nephew, took reign.

The Mughal Empire ruled the region until it was severely weakened in the eighteenth century. As Mughal power weakened, Afghan rulers took control of the region.

Most of the Punjabi homeland formed a province of British India, though a number of small princely states retained local rulers who recognized British authority. The Punjab with its rich farmlands became one of the most important colonial assets. Lahore was a noted center of learning and culture, and Rawalpindi became an important military installation. Most Punjabis supported the British during World War I, providing men and resources to the war effort even though the Punjab remained a source of anti colonial activities.:\u200a163\u200a Disturbances in the region increased as the war continued. At the end of the war, high casualty rates, heavy taxation, inflation, and a widespread influenza epidemic disrupted Punjabi society. In 1919 a British officer ordered his troops to fire on a crowd of demonstrators, mostly Sikhs in Amritsar. The Jallianwala massacre fueled the indian independence movement. Nationalists declared the independence of India from Lahore in 1930 but were quickly suppressed. When the Second World War broke out, nationalism in British India had already divided into religious movements. Many Sikhs and other minorities supported the Hindus, who promised a secular multicultural and multireligious society, and Muslim leaders in Lahore passed a resolution to work for a Muslim Pakistan, making the Punjab region a center of growing conflict between Indian and Pakistani nationalists. At the end of the war, the British granted separate independence to India and Pakistan, setting off massive communal violence as Muslims fled to Pakistan and Hindu and Sikh Punjabis fled east to India.The British Raj had major political, cultural, philosophical, and literary consequences in the Punjab, including the establishment of a new system of education. During the independence movement, many Punjabis played a significant role, including Madan Lal Dhingra, Sukhdev Thapar, Ajit Singh Sandhu, Bhagat Singh, Udham Singh, Kartar Singh Sarabha, Bhai Parmanand, Choudhry Rahmat Ali, and Lala Lajpat Rai. At the time of partition in 1947, the province was split into East and West Punjab. East Punjab (48%) became part of India, while West Punjab (52%) became part of Pakistan. The Punjab bore the brunt of the civil unrest following partition, with casualties estimated to be in the millions.Another major consequence of partition was the sudden shift towards religious homogeneity occurred in all districts across Punjab owing to the new international border that cut through the province. This rapid demographic shift was primarily due to wide scale migration but also caused by large-scale religious cleansing riots which were witnessed across the region at the time.

Moreover, the province as constituted under British rule also included a large tract outside these boundaries. Along the northern border, Himalayan ranges divided it from Kashmir and Tibet. On the west it was separated from the North-West Frontier Province by the Indus, until it reached the border of Dera Ghazi Khan District, which was divided from Baluchistan by the Sulaiman Range. To the south lay Sindh and Rajputana, while on the east the rivers Jumna and Tons separated it from the United Provinces. In total Punjab had an area of approximately 357 000 km square about the same size as modern day Germany, being one of the largest provinces of the British Raj.\n\nIt encompassed the present day Indian states of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, and some parts of Himachal Pradesh which were merged with Punjab by the British for administrative purposes (but excluding the former princely states which were later combined into the Patiala and East Punjab States Union) and the Pakistani regions of the Punjab, Islamabad Capital Territory and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nIn 1901 the frontier districts beyond the Indus were separated from Punjab and made into a new province: the North-West Frontier Province.

Amongst the peasantry and urban middle classes, the Hindus were the most active National Congress supporters, the Sikhs flocked to the Akali movement whilst the Muslims eventually supported the Muslim League.Since the partition of the sub-continent had been decided, special meetings of the Western and Eastern Section of the Legislative Assembly were held on 23 June 1947 to decide whether or not the Province of the Punjab be partitioned. After voting on both sides, partition was decided and the existing Punjab Legislative Assembly was also divided into West Punjab Legislative Assembly and the East Punjab Legislative Assembly. This last Assembly before independence, held its last sitting on 4 July 1947.\n\n\n=== Major cities ===\n\nHistorically, Lahore has been the capital of the Punjab region and continues to be the most populous city in the region, with a population of 11 million for the city proper.

During the hot season, from mid-April to the end of June, the temperature may reach 49 \u00b0C (120 \u00b0F). The monsoon season, from July to September, is a period of heavy rainfall, providing water for crops in addition to the supply from canals and irrigation systems. The transitional period after the monsoon season is cool and mild, leading to the winter season, when the temperature in January falls to 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F) at night and 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) by day.

Dogri, Kangri, and other western Pahari dialects are spoken in the north-central and northeastern parts of the region, while Bagri is spoken in south-central and southeastern sections.

The historical Vedic religion constituted the religious ideas and practices in the Punjab during the Vedic period (1500\u2013500 BCE), centered primarily in the worship of Indra. The bulk of the Rigveda was composed in the Punjab region between circa 1500 and 1200 BC, while later Vedic scriptures were composed more eastwards, between the Yamuna and Ganges rivers. An ancient Indian law book called the Manusmriti, developed by Brahmin Hindu priests, shaped Punjabi religious life from 200 BC onward.Later, the spread of Buddhisim and Jainism in the Indian subcontinent saw the growth of Buddhism and Jainism in the Punjab. Islam was introduced via southern Punjab in the 8th century, becoming the majority by the 16th century, via local conversion. There was a small Jain community left in Punjab by the 16th century, while the Buddhist community had largely disappeared by the turn of the 10th century. The region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of the Punjab region.The rise of Sikhism in the 1700s saw some Punjabis, both Hindu and Muslim, accepting the new Sikh faith. A number of Punjabis during the colonial period of India became Christians, with all of these religions characterizing the religious diversity now found in the Punjab region.\n\n\n==== Colonial era ====\n\nA number of Punjabis during the colonial period of India became Christians, with all of these religions characterizing the religious diversity now found in the Punjab region. Additionally during the colonial era, the practice of religious syncretism among Punjabi Muslims and Punjabi Hindus was noted and documented by officials in census reports:\n\n\"In other parts of the Province, too, traces of Hindu festivals are noticeable among the Muhammadans. In the western Punjab, Baisakhi, the new year's day of the Hindus, is celebrated as an agricultural festival, by all Muhammadans, by racing bullocks yoked to the well gear, with the beat of tom-toms, and large crowds gather to witness the show, The race is called Baisakhi and is a favourite pastime in the well-irrigated tracts. Then the processions of Tazias, in Muharram, with the accompaniment of tom-toms, fencing parties and bands playing on flutes and other musical instruments (which is disapproved by the orthodox Muhammadans) and the establishment of Sabils (shelters where water and sharbat are served out) are clearly influenced by similar practices at Hindu festivals, while the illuminations on occasions like the Chiraghan fair of Shalamar (Lahore) are no doubt practices answering to the holiday-making instinct of the converted Hindus.\":\u200a174\u200a\"Besides actual conversion, Islam has had a considerable influence on the Hindu religion. The sects of reformers based on a revolt from the orthodoxy of Varnashrama Dharma were obviously the outcome of the knowledge that a different religion could produce equally pious and right thinking men.

Historic census reports taken in the colonial era details the main castes are represented, alongside numerous subcastes and tribes (also known as J\u0101ti or Bar\u0101dar\u012b), formed parts of the various ethnic groups in the region, contemporarily known as Punjabis, Saraikis, Haryanvis, Hindkowans, Dogras, Paharis, and more.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe historical region of Punjab produces a relatively high proportion of the food output from India and Pakistan. The region has been used for extensive wheat farming. In addition, rice, cotton, sugarcane, fruit, and vegetables are also grown.The agricultural output of the Punjab region in Pakistan contributes significantly to Pakistan's GDP. Both Indian and Pakistani Punjab is considered to have the best infrastructure of their respective countries. The Indian state of Punjab is currently the 16th richest state or the eighth richest large state of India. Pakistani Punjab produces 68% of Pakistan's foodgrain production. Its share of Pakistan's GDP has historically ranged from 51.8% to 54.7%.Called \"The Granary of India\" or \"The Bread Basket of India\", Indian Punjab produces 1% of the world's rice, 2% of its wheat, and 2% of its cotton. In 2001, it was recorded that farmers made up 39% of Indian Punjab's workforce. In the Punjab region of Pakistan, 42.3% of the labour force is engaged in the agriculture sector.Alternatively, Punjab is also adding to the economy with the increase in employment of Punjab youth in the private sector. Government schemes such as 'Ghar Ghar Rozgar and Karobar Mission' have brought enhanced employability in the private sector. As of October 2019, more than 32,000 youths have been placed in different jobs and 12,000 have been skill-trained.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Punjab\nSattagydia\nChak (village)\nDhani (settlement type)\nJallianwala Bagh\nMusic of Punjab\nPunjabi cuisine\nPunjabi dance\nPanjab Digital Library\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDyson, Tim (2018).

'Land of Kings') is a state in northern India. It covers 342,239 square kilometres (132,139 sq mi) or 10.4 per cent of India's total geographical area. It is the largest Indian state by area and the seventh largest by population. It is on India's northwestern side, where it comprises most of the wide and inhospitable Thar Desert (also known as the Great Indian Desert) and shares a border with the Pakistani provinces of Punjab to the northwest and Sindh to the west, along the Sutlej-Indus River valley. It is bordered by five other Indian states: Punjab to the north; Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to the northeast; Madhya Pradesh to the southeast; and Gujarat to the southwest. Its geographical location is 23\u00b0.3' to 30\u00b0.12' North latitude and 69\u00b0.30' to 78\u00b0.17' East longitude, with the Tropic of Cancer passing through its southernmost tip.\nIts major features include the ruins of the Indus Valley civilisation at Kalibangan and Balathal, the Dilwara Temples, a Jain pilgrimage site at Rajasthan's only hill station, Mount Abu, in the ancient Aravalli mountain range and eastern Rajasthan, the Keoladeo National Park of Bharatpur, a World Heritage Site known for its bird life. Rajasthan is also home to three national tiger reserves, the Ranthambore National Park in Sawai Madhopur, Sariska Tiger Reserve in Alwar and the Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve in Kota.\nThe State of Rajasthan was formed on 30 March 1949 when the states of the Rajputana Agency of the erstwhile British Empire in India were merged into the new Indian Union. Its capital and largest city is Jaipur. Other important cities are Jodhpur, Kota, Bikaner, Ajmer, Bharatpur and Udaipur. The economy of Rajasthan is the seventh-largest state economy in India with \u20b910.20 lakh crore (US$130 billion) in gross domestic product and a per capita GDP of \u20b9118,000 (US$1,500). Rajasthan ranks 22nd among Indian states in human development index.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nRajasthan means \"The Land of Kings\" and is a portmanteau of Sanskrit \"R\u0101j\u0101\" ('King') and Sanskrit \"Sth\u0101na\" ('Land') or Persian \"St(h)\u0101n\", with the same meaning. The oldest reference to Rajasthan is found in a stone inscription dated back to 625 CE. The first printed mention of the name Rajasthan appears in the 1829 publication Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan or the Central and Western Rajpoot States of India, while the earliest known record of Rajputana as a name for the region is in George Thomas's 1800 memoir Military Memories. John Keay, in his book India: A History, stated that Rajputana was coined by the British in 1829, John Briggs, translating Ferishta's history of early Islamic India, used the phrase \"Rajpoot (Rajput) princes\" rather than \"Indian princes\".\n\n\n== History ==", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2762, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d87e8f3e-8e5a-4468-8b2d-b89e4c2b359e": {"__data__": {"id_": "d87e8f3e-8e5a-4468-8b2d-b89e4c2b359e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Rajasthan.txt", "file_name": "Rajasthan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42900, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0a4ebb42-587a-4d0b-be00-f5a48e231a3f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Rajasthan.txt", "file_name": "Rajasthan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42900, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9eaad55f23598e9a3dc016a5226165ec1c072e7519eacd09417c1fdb04a32e43", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "494700e4-7d0d-4418-9104-cbe355411d8d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Rajasthan.txt", "file_name": "Rajasthan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42900, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "cccc81044124131c3eda7bbf228bcb412cf079d27fffb0d72aafe605b6b7e11b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b65fa414-8140-4f41-9993-b9d9bc7cc623", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cb7f572978285cf44e7415da1796dd76627072b4d59fd5961d9315d2155f2c3e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient times ===\nParts of what is now Rajasthan were partly part of the Vedic Civilisation and the Indus Valley civilisation. Kalibangan, in Hanumangarh district, was a major provincial capital of the Indus Valley Civilization. Topsfield writes that the Rajputs first entered India from the north west in the first millennium A.D. They established kingdoms in western India in the region that is now known as Rajasthan.A archaeological excavation at the Balathal site in Udaipur district shows a settlement contemporary with the Harrapan civilisation dating back to 3000\u20131500 BCE. Stone Age tools dating from 5,000 to 200,000 years were found in Bundi and Bhilwara districts of the state.The Matsya kingdom of the Vedic civilisation of India is said to roughly corresponded to the former state of Jaipur in Rajasthan and included the whole of Alwar with portions of Bharatpur. The capital of Matsya was at Viratanagar (modern Bairat), which is said to have been named after its founder King Virata.Bhargava identifies the two districts of Jhunjhunu and Sikar and parts of Jaipur district along with Haryana districts of Mahendragarh and Rewari as part of Vedic state of Brahmavarta. Bhargava also locates the present day Sahibi River as the Vedic Drishadwati River, which along with Saraswati River formed the borders of the Vedic state of Brahmavarta. Manu and Bhrigu narrated the Manusmriti to a congregation of seers in this area. The ashrams of Vedic seers Bhrigu and his son Chayvan Rishi, for whom Chyawanprash was formulated, were near Dhosi Hill, part of which lies in Dhosi village of Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan and part of which lies in Mahendragarh district of Haryana.The Western Kshatrapas (405\u201335 BCE), the Saka rulers of the western part of India, were successors to the Indo-Scythians and were contemporaneous with the Kushans, who ruled the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. The Indo-Scythians invaded the area of Ujjain and established the Saka era (with their calendar), marking the beginning of the long-lived Saka Western Satraps state.\n\n\n=== Classical era ===\n\n\n==== Gurjara-Pratihara ====\nThe Pratiharas ruled for many dynasties in this part of the country; the region was known as Gurjaratra. Up to the 10th century CE, almost all of North India acknowledged the supremacy of the Imperial Pratiharas, with their seat of power at Kannauj.The Gurjara Pratihar Empire acted as a barrier for Arab invaders from the 8th to the 11th century. The chief accomplishment of the Gurjara-Pratihara Empire lies in its successful resistance to foreign invasions from the west, starting in the days of Junaid. Historian R. C. Majumdar says that this was openly acknowledged by the Arab writers. He further notes that historians of India have wondered at the slow progress of Muslim invaders in India, as compared with their rapid advance in other parts of the world. Now there seems little doubt that it was the power of the Pratihara army that effectively barred the progress of the Arabs beyond the confines of Sindh, their only conquest for nearly 300 years.", "start_char_idx": 2749, "end_char_idx": 5853, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b65fa414-8140-4f41-9993-b9d9bc7cc623": {"__data__": {"id_": "b65fa414-8140-4f41-9993-b9d9bc7cc623", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Rajasthan.txt", "file_name": "Rajasthan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42900, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0a4ebb42-587a-4d0b-be00-f5a48e231a3f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Rajasthan.txt", "file_name": "Rajasthan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42900, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9eaad55f23598e9a3dc016a5226165ec1c072e7519eacd09417c1fdb04a32e43", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d87e8f3e-8e5a-4468-8b2d-b89e4c2b359e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Rajasthan.txt", "file_name": "Rajasthan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42900, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "5ca73a3c6026f5b41af62d1617c7aeb761403b6164b48d135dc24b4c8e053432", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "376aadd8-618e-4659-b042-4c39765d2412", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1702b6550fdf5a766989edf3f264ff42534c06281dfc2d0c955d5991b3e4d173", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Medieval and early modern eras ===\n\nThe Ghurids had made an attempt to invade India through southern Rajasthan, however they were defeated in the Battle of Kasahrada on 1178 by a confederacy of Rajputs under Mularaja II of Chaulukya dynasty.

At the beginning of the 13th century, the most prominent and powerful state of Rajasthan was Mewar. Since the invasion of the Muslim Turks from the 13th century onwards, the Rajputs resisted the Muslim incursions into India, and preserved Hindu culture at their courts,The Rajputs put up resistance to the Islamic invasions with their warfare and chivalry for centuries. The Ranas of Mewar led other kingdoms in their resistance to outside rule. Rana Hammir Singh defeated the Tughlaq dynasty and recovered a large portion of Rajasthan. The indomitable Rana Kumbha defeated the Sultans of Malwa, Nagaur and Gujarat and made Mewar the most powerful Rajput Kingdom in India. The ambitious Rana Sanga united the various Rajput clans, including the Muslim Khanzadas of Mewat under Raja Hasan Khan Mewati, and fought against the foreign powers in India. Rana Sanga defeated the Afghan Lodi Empire of Delhi and crushed the Turkic Sultanates of Malwa and Gujarat. Rana Sanga then tried to create an Indian empire but was defeated by the first Mughal Emperor Babur at Khanwa. The defeat was due to betrayal by the Tomar King Silhadi of Raisen. After Rana Sanga's death, Marwar rose as a power center in Rajasthan under Rao Maldeo Rathore. He conquered Jaisalmer, parts of Gujarat, Jalore, Nagaur, Ajmer, Sanchore, Bhinmal, Radhanpur, Bayana, Tonk, Toda and Nabhara. He expanded the territories of Marwar up to Sindh-Cholistan in west and his northern boundary was just fifty kilometres from Delhi. After defeating Humayun, Sher Shah came towards Rajputana. He defeated Chiefs of Rathore army by trickery in Battle of Sammel and captured some territory of Marwar but it was recovered by Rathores in 1545.Hem Chandra Vikramaditya, the Hindu emperor, was born in the village of Machheri in Alwar District in 1501. He won 22 battles against Afghans, from Punjab to Bengal including the states of Ajmer and Alwar in Rajasthan, and defeated Akbar's forces twice, first at Agra and then at Delhi in 1556 at Battle of Delhi before acceding to the throne of Delhi and establishing the \"Hindu Raj\" in North India, albeit for a short duration, from Purana Qila in Delhi. Hem Chandra was killed in the battlefield at Second Battle of Panipat fighting against Mughals on 5 November 1556.", "start_char_idx": 5856, "end_char_idx": 8798, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "376aadd8-618e-4659-b042-4c39765d2412": {"__data__": {"id_": "376aadd8-618e-4659-b042-4c39765d2412", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Rajasthan.txt", "file_name": "Rajasthan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42900, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0a4ebb42-587a-4d0b-be00-f5a48e231a3f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Rajasthan.txt", "file_name": "Rajasthan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42900, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9eaad55f23598e9a3dc016a5226165ec1c072e7519eacd09417c1fdb04a32e43", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b65fa414-8140-4f41-9993-b9d9bc7cc623", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Rajasthan.txt", "file_name": "Rajasthan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42900, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "7eeea53ee3b7c3fd966357cc1add116f84c161273ebadd545fea07be608e9991", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e89a1725-85ed-4fe5-94a6-9cbaf049eee8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6b19a95221ae3c5995d9ea5f0a349f500bc698c30bf4d9a09e4cea65e85dcb5b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Hem Chandra was killed in the battlefield at Second Battle of Panipat fighting against Mughals on 5 November 1556.\n\nDuring Akbar's reign most of the Rajput kings accepted Mughal suzerainty, but the rulers of Mewar (Rana Udai Singh II) and Marwar (Rao Chandrasen Rathore) refused to have any form of alliance with the Mughals. To teach the Rajputs a lesson Akbar attacked Udai Singh and killed Rajput commander Jaimal of Chitor and the citizens of Mewar in large numbers. Akbar killed 20,000\u201325,000 unarmed citizens in Chittor on the grounds that they had actively helped in the resistance.Maharana Pratap took an oath to avenge the citizens of Chittor; he fought the Mughal empire till his death and liberated most of Mewar apart from Chittor itself. Maharana Pratap soon became the most celebrated warrior of Rajasthan and became famous all over India for his sporadic warfare and noble actions. According to Satish Chandra, \"Rana Pratap's defiance of the mighty Mughal empire, almost alone and unaided by the other Rajput states, constitutes a glorious saga of Rajput valor and the spirit of self-sacrifice for cherished principles. Rana Pratap's methods of sporadic warfare were later elaborated further by Malik Ambar, the Deccani general, and by Shivaji\".Rana Amar Singh I continued his ancestor's war against the Mughals under Jehangir, he repelled the Mughal armies at Dewar. Later an expedition was again sent under the leadership of Prince Khurram, which caused much damage to life and property of Mewar.

Modern Rajasthan includes most of Rajputana, which comprises the erstwhile nineteen princely states, three chiefships, and the British district of Ajmer-Merwara. Jaisalmer, Marwar (Jodhpur), Bikaner, Mewar (Chittorgarh), Alwar and Dhundhar (Jaipur) were some of the main Rajput princely states. Bharatpur and Dholpur were Jat princely states whereas Tonk was a princely state under Pathans. The three chiefships were Lawa, Neemrana and Kushalgarh.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe geographic features of Rajasthan are the Thar Desert and the Aravalli Range, which runs through the state from southwest to northeast, almost from one end to the other, for more than 850 kilometres (530 mi). Mount Abu lies at the southwestern end of the range, separated from the main ranges by the West Banas River. Although a series of broken ridges continues into Haryana in the direction of Delhi where it can be seen as outcrops in the form of the Raisina Hill and the ridges farther north. About three-fifths of Rajasthan lies northwest of the Aravallis, leaving two-fifths on the east and south direction.\n\nThe Aravalli Range runs across the state from the southwest peak Guru Shikhar (Mount Abu), which is 1,722 metres (5,650 ft) in height, to Khetri in the northeast. This range divides the state into 60% in the northwest of the range and 40% in the southeast. The northwest tract is sandy and unproductive with little water but improves gradually from desert land in the far west and northwest to comparatively fertile and habitable land towards the east. The south-eastern area, higher in elevation (100 to 350 m above sea level) and more fertile, has a very diversified topography. In the south lies the hilly tract of Mewar. In the southeast, a large area within the districts of Kota and Bundi forms a tableland. To the northeast of these districts is a rugged region (badlands) following the line of the Chambal River. Farther north the country levels out; the flat plains of the northeastern Bharatpur district are part of an alluvial basin. Merta City lies in the geographical center of Rajasthan.The Aravalli Range and the lands to the east and southeast of the range are generally more fertile and better watered.

This region is home to the Khathiar-Gir dry deciduous forests ecoregion, with tropical dry broadleaf forests that include teak, Acacia, and other trees. The hilly Vagad region, home to the cities of Dungarpur, Pratapgarh, and Banswara lies in southernmost Rajasthan, on the border with Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. With the exception of Mount Abu, Vagad is the wettest region in Rajasthan, and the most heavily forested. North of Vagad lies the Mewar region, home to the cities of Udaipur and Chittaurgarh. The Hadoti region lies to the southeast, on the border with Madhya Pradesh. North of Hadoti and Mewar lies the Dhundhar region, home to the state capital of Jaipur. Mewat, the easternmost region of Rajasthan, borders Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Eastern and southeastern Rajasthan is drained by the Banas and Chambal rivers, tributaries of the Ganges.\nThe northwestern portion of Rajasthan is generally sandy and dry. Most of this region is covered by the Thar Desert which extends into adjoining portions of Pakistan. The Aravalli Range does not intercept the moisture-giving southwest monsoon winds off the Arabian Sea, as it lies in a direction parallel to that of the coming monsoon winds, leaving the northwestern region in a rain shadow. The Thar Desert is thinly populated; the City of Jodhpur is the largest city in the desert and a major metropolitan area of India which is known as the gateway of the Thar desert. The desert has some major districts like Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner, and Nagaur. This area is also important from a defence point of view. Jodhpur airbase is one of the largest airbases in India, BSF and Military bases are also situated here. Currently four civil airports are located here: Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bikaner and Nagaur, of which Jodhpur is the major civil airport, being the 44th busiest airport in India and one of the oldest air strips of India, being built in the 1920s.\nThe Northwestern thorn scrub forests lie in a band around the Thar Desert, between the desert and the Aravallis. This region receives less than 400  mm of rain annually. Temperatures can sometimes exceed 45 \u00b0C in the summer months and drop below freezing point in the winter. The Godwar, Marwar, and Shekhawati regions lie in the thorn scrub forest zone, along with the city of Jodhpur. The Luni River and its tributaries are the major river system of Godwar and Marwar regions, draining the western slopes of the Aravallis and emptying southwest into the great Rann of Kutch wetland in neighbouring Gujarat. This river is saline in the lower reaches and remains potable only up to Balotara in Barmer district.

Seashells and massive fossilised tree trunks in this park record the geological history of the desert. The region is a haven for migratory and resident birds of the desert. One can see many eagles, harriers, falcons, buzzards, kestrels and vultures. Short-toed snake eagles (Circaetus gallicus), tawny eagles (Aquila rapax), spotted eagles (Aquila clanga), laggar falcons (Falco jugger) and kestrels are some of the raptor species seen in Desert National Park. Road traffic inside the Park is, however, a threat to several wild species of the park with several species of amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals reported to have died as roadkill.The Ranthambore National Park located in Sawai Madhopur, one of the well known tiger reserves in the country, became a part of Project Tiger in 1973.\nTal Chhapar Sanctuary is a very small sanctuary in Sujangarh, Churu District, 210 kilometres (130 mi) from Jaipur in the Shekhawati region. This sanctuary is home to a large population of blackbuck. Desert foxes and the caracal, an apex predator, also known as the desert lynx, can also be spotted, along with birds such as the partridge, harriers, eastern imperial eagle, pale harrier, marsh harrier, short-toed eagle, tawny eagle, sparrow hawk, crested lark, demoiselle crane, skylarks, green bee-eater, brown dove, black ibis, and sand grouse. The great Indian bustard, known locally as the godavan, and which is a state bird, has been classed as critically endangered since 2011.\n\n\n=== Wildlife protection ===\nRajasthan is also noted for its national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. There are four national parks and wildlife sanctuaries: Keoladeo National Park of Bharatpur, Sariska Tiger Reserve of Alwar, Ranthambore National Park of Sawai Madhopur, and Desert National Park of Jaisalmer. A national-level institute, Arid Forest Research Institute (AFRI) an autonomous institute of the ministry of forestry is situated in Jodhpur and continuously works on desert flora and their conservation.\nRanthambore National Park is 7 km from Sawai Madhopur Railway Station.

Sindhi is also common in the cities and along the border with Sindh in Pakistan where Dhatki, a transition between Marwari and Sindhi, is the main dialect on both sides of the border.The languages taught under the three-language formula are:\nFirst language: Hindi\nSecond language: English\nThird language: Gujarati, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Sindhi or Urdu\n\n\n== Culture ==", "start_char_idx": 30809, "end_char_idx": 33793, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a6c87da-f854-4086-8663-c25c1c0732ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a6c87da-f854-4086-8663-c25c1c0732ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Rajasthan.txt", "file_name": "Rajasthan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42900, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0a4ebb42-587a-4d0b-be00-f5a48e231a3f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Rajasthan.txt", "file_name": "Rajasthan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42900, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9eaad55f23598e9a3dc016a5226165ec1c072e7519eacd09417c1fdb04a32e43", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "103f8b4e-ffdc-48f3-b007-63082aba76a1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Rajasthan.txt", "file_name": "Rajasthan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42900, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "1e905b9418eb09a886bee463638d7167e1206dbe1acfa67a2fadd196eac6da5e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1d847508-42c7-46f2-83a2-92093f9acf75", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "68b2f144d5425687438e6514ec3e0dd60007bfbd92cb043f442e2d15b95b7def", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Food ===\nRajasthani cooking was influenced by both the war-like lifestyles of its inhabitants and the availability of ingredients in this arid region. Food that could last for several days and could be eaten without heating was preferred. Thus, pickles of Rajasthan are quite famous for their tangy and spicy flavour. The Panchkuta delicacy is also a famous one \u2013 meaning 5 vegetables \u2013 a dish that lasts for several days, and is made out of certain weed plants that only grow in the wild desert. The scarcity of water and fresh green vegetables have all had their effect on cooking. It is known for its snacks like Bikaneri Bhujia. Other famous dishes include bajre ki roti (millet bread) and lahsun ki chutney (hot garlic paste), mawa kachori Mirchi Bada, Pyaaj Kachori and ghevar from Jodhpur, Alwar ka Mawa (milk cake), Kadhi kachori from Ajmer, Malpua from Pushkar, Daal kachori (Kota kachori) from Kota and rassgullas from Bikaner. Originating from the Marwar region of the state is the concept of Marwari Bhojnalaya or vegetarian restaurants, today found in many parts of India, which offer vegetarian food popular among Marwari people. Ghee is an essential ingredient in most Rajasthani cuisines, and dollops of ghee are poured over food as a welcoming gesture for guests. Dal-baati-churma is very popular in Rajasthan. The traditional way to serve it is to first coarsely mash the baati, and then pour pure ghee on top of it. It is served with daal (lentils) and spicy garlic chutney; it is also served with besan (gram flour) ki kadi. It is commonly served at all festivities, including religious occasions, wedding ceremonies, and birthday parties in Rajasthan.\n\n\n=== Music and dance ===\nThe Ghoomar dance from Jaipur, Jodhpur, and Kalbelia of the Kalbelia tribe has gained international recognition. Folk music is a large part of the Rajasthani culture. The Manganiyar, Meena and Langa communities from Rajasthan are notable for their folk music. Kathputli, Bhopa, Chang, Teratali, Ghindr, Gair dance, Kachchhi Ghori, and Tejaji are examples of traditional Rajasthani culture. Folk songs are commonly ballads that relate heroic deeds and love stories; and religious or devotional songs known as bhajans and banis which are often accompanied by musical instruments like dholak, sitar, and sarangi are also sung.\n\n\n=== Art ===\nRajasthan is known for its traditional, colourful art. The block prints, tie and dye prints, gota patti (main), Bagaru prints, Sanganer prints, and Zari embroidery are major export products from Rajasthan. Handicraft items like wooden furniture and crafts, carpets, and blue pottery are commonly found here. Shopping reflects the colourful culture, Rajasthani clothes have a lot of mirror work and embroidery.  Traditional Rajasthani dress for females consists of an ankle-length skirt and a short top, known as chaniya choli.  A piece of cloth is used to cover the head, both for protection from heat and maintenance of modesty. Rajasthani dresses are usually designed in bright colours such as blue, yellow, and orange.", "start_char_idx": 33780, "end_char_idx": 36858, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d847508-42c7-46f2-83a2-92093f9acf75": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d847508-42c7-46f2-83a2-92093f9acf75", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Rajasthan.txt", "file_name": "Rajasthan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42900, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0a4ebb42-587a-4d0b-be00-f5a48e231a3f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Rajasthan.txt", "file_name": "Rajasthan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42900, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9eaad55f23598e9a3dc016a5226165ec1c072e7519eacd09417c1fdb04a32e43", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8a6c87da-f854-4086-8663-c25c1c0732ac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Rajasthan.txt", "file_name": "Rajasthan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42900, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "e4ce6cb8454d8b9214272a13fe1908733eceab767c77ac762a6d54e6782d1ef8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b652e111-8c67-4ca1-8050-a40092fe6689", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9d07bb01e3dbd83f463eaac3d9b8f52cd76ac09f083705e0b7e3adc37cc52c93", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Education ==\n\nIn recent years, Rajasthan has worked on improving education. The state government has been making sustained efforts to raise the education standard.\nSchools in the state are either managed by the government or by private trusts. The medium of instruction in most of the schools is mainly English, or Hindi. Under the 10+2+3 plan, after completing secondary school, students typically enrol for two years in a junior college, also known as pre-university, or in schools with a higher secondary facility affiliated with the Board of Secondary Education or any central board. Students choose from one of three streams, namely liberal arts, commerce, or science. Upon completing the required coursework, students may enrol in general or professional degree programs. The secondary schools are affiliated with the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), and the National Institute of Open School (NIOS).\nRajasthan has 52 universities, 26 state funded public universities, 7 deemed universities, an IIT in Jodhpur, an IIM in Udaipur, an NIT in Jaipur, a National Law University in Jodhpur, and one central and state-run university. Kota, is renowned for being a hub for training students in various national-level competitive exams that are necessary for securing admission to engineering and medical colleges across the country. In order to promote a reading culture among the rural population, the state has established new libraries up to the panchayat level and computerised all public libraries throughout the state, providing modern amenities to readers and subscriber.\n\n\n=== Literacy ===\nIn recent decades the literacy rate of Rajasthan has increased significantly.

At the Census 2011, Rajasthan had a literacy rate of 67.06% (80.51% male and 52.66% female). Although Rajasthan's literacy rate is below the national average of 74.04% and although its female literacy rate is the lowest in the country, the state has been praised for its efforts and achievements in raising literacy rates.In rural areas of Rajasthan, the literacy rate is 76.16% for males and 45.8% for females.

The Sikh scriptures are written in the Gurumukhi script particular to Sikhs. It is one of the most recently founded major religious groups and among the largest in the world, with about 25\u201330 million adherents (known as Sikhs).Sikhism developed from the spiritual teachings of Guru Nanak (1469\u20131539), the faith's first guru, and the nine Sikh gurus who succeeded him. The tenth guru, Gobind Singh (1666\u20131708), named the Sikh scripture Guru Granth Sahib as his successor, bringing to a close the line of human gurus and establishing the scripture as the 11th and last eternally living guru, a religious spiritual/life guide for Sikhs. Guru Nanak taught that living an \"active, creative, and practical life\" of \"truthfulness, fidelity, self-control and purity\" is above metaphysical truth, and that the ideal man \"establishes union with God, knows His Will, and carries out that Will\". Guru Hargobind, the sixth Sikh Guru (1606\u20131644), established the concept of mutual co-existence of the miri ('political'/'temporal') and piri ('spiritual') realms.\nThe Sikh scripture opens with the Mul Mantar or alternatively spelled \"Mool Mantar\" (\u0a2e\u0a42\u0a32 \u0a2e\u0a70\u0a24\u0a30), fundamental prayer about Ik Onkar (\u0a74, 'One God'). The core beliefs of Sikhism, articulated in the Guru Granth Sahib, include faith and meditation in the name of the one creator; divine unity and equality of all humankind; engaging in seva ('selfless service'); striving for justice for the benefit and prosperity of all; and honest conduct and livelihood while living a householder's life. Following this standard, Sikhism rejects claims that any particular religious tradition has a monopoly on Absolute truth. Sikhism emphasizes simran (\u0a38\u0a3f\u0a2e\u0a30\u0a28, meditation and remembrance of the teachings of Gurus), which can be expressed musically through kirtan, or internally through naam japna ('meditation on His name') as a means to feel God's presence. It teaches followers to transform the \"Five Thieves\" (i.e., lust, rage, greed, attachment, and ego).\n\nThe religion developed and evolved in times of religious persecution, gaining converts from both Hinduism and Islam. Mughal rulers of India tortured and executed two of the Sikh gurus\u2014Guru Arjan (1563\u20131605) and Guru Tegh Bahadur (1621\u20131675)\u2014after they refused to convert to Islam. The persecution of Sikhs triggered the founding of the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699 as an order to protect the freedom of conscience and religion, with members expressing the qualities of a Sant-Sip\u0101h\u012b ('saint-soldier').

Adherents of Sikhism are known as Sikhs, meaning 'students' or 'disciples' of the Guru. The English word Sikhism derives from the Punjabi verb Sikhi (Punjabi: \u0a38\u0a3f\u0a71\u0a16\u0a40 Sikkh\u012b, [\u02c8s\u026ak.k\u02b0i\u02d0] , from \u0a38\u0a3f\u0a71\u0a16, Sikh, 'disciple / learner'), which connotes the \"temporal path of learning\" and is rooted in the word sikhana ('to learn').\n\n\n== Philosophy and teachings ==\n\nSikhism is classified as an Indian religion or Dharmic religion along with Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism.The basis of Sikhism lies in the teachings of Guru Nanak and his successors. Sikh ethics emphasize the congruence between spiritual development and everyday moral conduct. Its founder, Guru Nanak summarized, this perspective as: \"Truth is the highest virtue, but higher still is truthful living.\":\u200a234\u200a Sikhism lays emphasis on \u0116k n\u016br te sab jag upji\u0101, 'From the one light, the entire universe welled up.'\n\n\n=== Teachings ===\nSikhism is a monotheistic and panentheistic religion: There exists only one God, and that God is simultaneously within and all-encompassing. That God is symbolized as Ik Onkar in the Gurmukhi script of Punjabi. In Sikhism, the overall concept of God is Waheguru (wondrous Teacher); the Waheguru is considered to be nirankar ('shapeless'), akal ('timeless'), karta purakh ('the creator'), and agam agochar ('incomprehensible and invisible').In a literal sense, God has no gender in Sikhism, but, metaphorically, God is presented as masculine and God's power as feminine. For example, God is repeatedly referred to by the name akaal purkh ('beyond time and space') and nirankar ('without form') by the tenth guru, Gobind Singh Ji; he also refers to God as his father, and God's creative power as his mother. Similarly, another example is that the Sikh scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib says that all humans are soul-brides who long to unite with their husband Lord. In addition, the gurus also wrote in the Guru Granth Sahib that there are many worlds on which the transcendental God has created life.The Sikh scripture begins with God as Ik Onkar (\u0a74), the 'formless one',:\u200a227\u200a understood in the Sikh tradition as monotheistic unity of God. Ik onkar (sometimes capitalized) is more loosely rendered 'the one supreme reality', 'the one creator', 'the all-pervading spirit', and other ways of expressing a diffused but unified and singular sense of God and creation.The traditional Mul Mantar goes from ik onkar until Nanak hosee bhee sach The opening line of the Guru Granth Sahib and each subsequent raga, mentions ik onkar:", "start_char_idx": 3001, "end_char_idx": 5731, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09c55c50-b505-42a1-9c2a-f85a9319f63a": {"__data__": {"id_": "09c55c50-b505-42a1-9c2a-f85a9319f63a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "debed2b2-7944-42a3-bcf8-552fa975eea7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "d67285a79ff7b131e10b65914e3d0a6ba77bbd4e73ea0e289767023d9f83f8d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f923b684-b7fd-4b83-b7bf-b97099078cab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "68697bde429cccdacc2c570f53954466d26f314845c0d38c3032097cf06b4c21", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "382766da-9bd1-4724-b999-a229c68acbf5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "02e49cc6384cbab14af4b0611cce2e79acca7ed657d867ea2862f5c7f61c9895", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Worldly Illusion ===\nM\u0101y\u0101, defined as a temporary illusion or \"unreality\", is one of the core deviations from the pursuit of God and salvation: where worldly attractions give only illusory temporary satisfaction and pain that distracts from the process of the devotion of God. However, Nanak emphasised m\u0101y\u0101 as not a reference to the unreality of the world, but of its values. In Sikhism, the influences of ego, anger, greed, attachment, and lust, known as the p\u0101nj chor ('Five Thieves'), are believed to be particularly distracting and hurtful. Sikhs believe the world is currently in a state of Kali Yuga ('age of darkness') because the world is led astray by the love of and attachment to m\u0101y\u0101. The fate of people vulnerable to the five thieves is separation from God, and the situation may be remedied only after intensive and relentless devotion.\n\n\n=== Timeless Truth ===\nAccording to Guru Nanak, the supreme purpose of human life is to reconnect with Akal ('The Timeless One'). However, egotism is the biggest barrier in making this connection. Using the Guru's teaching remembrance of n\u0101m (the divine Name of the Lord) leads to the end of egotism. Guru Nanak designated the word Guru ('teacher') to mean the voice of \"the spirit\": the source of knowledge and the guide to salvation. As ik onkar is universally immanent, Guru is indistinguishable from Akal and are one and the same. One connects with Guru only with accumulation of selfless search of truth. Ultimately the seeker realises that it is the consciousness within the body which is the seeker/follower of the Word that is the true Guru. The human body is just a means to achieve the reunion with Truth. Once truth starts to shine in a person's heart, the essence of current and past holy books of all religions is understood by the person.\n\n\n=== Liberation ===\nGuru Nanak's teachings are founded not on a final destination of heaven or hell, but on a spiritual union with the Akal, which results in salvation or jivanmukti ('enlightenment/liberation within one's lifetime'), a concept also found in Hinduism. Guru Gobind Singh makes it clear that human birth is obtained with great fortune, therefore one needs to be able to make the most of this life.Sikhs accept reincarnation and karma concepts found in Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism, but do not necessarily infer a metaphysical soteriology akin to those found in those other religions. However, in Sikhism, both karma and liberation \"is modified by the concept of God's grace\" (nadar, mehar, kirpa, karam, etc.). Guru Nanak states that \"the body takes birth because of karma, but salvation is attained through grace.\" To get closer to God, Sikhs: avoid the evils of maya; keep the everlasting truth in mind; practice shabad kirtan (musical recitation of hymns); meditate on naam; and serve humanity. Sikhs believe that being in the company of the satsang (association with sat, 'true', people) or sadh sangat is one of the key ways to achieve liberation from the cycles of reincarnation.\n\n\n=== Power and Devotion (Miri and Piri) ===\n\nMiri-Piri is a doctrine that has been practiced in Sikh religion since the seventeenth century.", "start_char_idx": 5734, "end_char_idx": 8890, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "382766da-9bd1-4724-b999-a229c68acbf5": {"__data__": {"id_": "382766da-9bd1-4724-b999-a229c68acbf5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "debed2b2-7944-42a3-bcf8-552fa975eea7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "d67285a79ff7b131e10b65914e3d0a6ba77bbd4e73ea0e289767023d9f83f8d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "09c55c50-b505-42a1-9c2a-f85a9319f63a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "c6ed800c81dfd428cf7621d4ec25f92b98ccf70ec43599256d2594f230458205", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "23cb3bce-2973-47d3-a8b1-c1841b754f9a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d62ffb354b2dc83301d83696fbd2187d79586f0231654148a89c293101676b0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Power and Devotion (Miri and Piri) ===\n\nMiri-Piri is a doctrine that has been practiced in Sikh religion since the seventeenth century. The doctrine of the \"Mir\" (social and political aspects of life) and the \"Pir\" (guides to spiritual aspect of life) was revealed by the first Guru of Sikhism, Guru Nanak, but propounded by the sixth Guru of Sikhism, Guru Hargobind, on 12 June 1606. After the martyrdom of his father, Guru Hargobind was elevated to the Guruship and fulfilled the prophecy that was given by the primal figure of Sikh, Baba Buddha, that the guru will possess spiritual and temporal power. Guru Hargobind introduced the two swords of Miri and Piri symbolizing both worldly (social and political) and spiritual authority. The two kirpan of Miri and Piri are tied together with a khanda in center, so the combination of both is considered supreme,  Where action informed or arising out of the spiritual heart completes one's purpose and meaning in the world of action: spirituality.Guru Nanak, the first Sikh Guru and the founder of Sikhism, was a Bhakti saint. He taught that the most important form of worship is Bhakti (devotion to Waheguru). Guru Arjan, in the Sukhmani Sahib, recommended the true religion is one of loving devotion to God. The Guru Granth Sahib includes suggestions on how a Sikh should perform constant Bhakti. Some scholars call Sikhism a Bhakti sect of Indian traditions, adding that it emphasises \"nirguni Bhakti\", i.e. loving devotion to a divine without qualities or physical form.:\u200a1\u20133\u200a While Western scholarship generally places Sikhism as arising primarily within a Hindu Bhakti movement milieu while recognizing some Sufi Islamic influences,:\u200a3,\u200a42\u20133\u200a some Indian Sikh scholars disagree and state that Sikhism transcended the environment it emerged from. The basis of the latter analysis is that Bhakti traditions did not clearly disassociate from Vedic texts and their cosmologies and metaphysical worldview, while the Sikh tradition clearly did disassociate from the Vedic tradition.Some Sikh sects outside the Punjab region of India, such as those found in Maharashtra and Bihar, practice aarti (the ceremonial use of lamps) during Bhakti observances in a Sikh gurdwara. But, most Sikh gurdwaras forbid aarti during their Bhakti practices.:\u200a201\u200aWhile emphasizing Bhakti, the Sikh gurus also taught that the spiritual life and secular householder life are intertwined, and not separate. This logically follows from the panentheistic nature of Sikh philosophy. In Sikh worldview, the everyday world is part of the Infinite Reality, increased spiritual awareness leads to increased and vibrant participation in the everyday world. Guru Nanak described living an \"active, creative, and practical life\" of \"truthfulness, fidelity, self-control and purity\" as being higher than the metaphysical truth.The 6th Sikh Guru, Guru Hargobind, after Guru Arjan's martyrdom, faced with oppression by the Islamic Mughal Empire, affirmed the philosophy that the political/temporal (Miri) and spiritual (Piri) realms are mutually coexistent. According to the 9th Sikh Guru, Tegh Bahadur, the ideal Sikh should have both Shakti (power that resides in the temporal), and Bhakti (spiritual meditative qualities).", "start_char_idx": 8751, "end_char_idx": 11995, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23cb3bce-2973-47d3-a8b1-c1841b754f9a": {"__data__": {"id_": "23cb3bce-2973-47d3-a8b1-c1841b754f9a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "debed2b2-7944-42a3-bcf8-552fa975eea7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "d67285a79ff7b131e10b65914e3d0a6ba77bbd4e73ea0e289767023d9f83f8d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "382766da-9bd1-4724-b999-a229c68acbf5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "0e67ca3a5da35c28ab7811eca7eaa9284be7802617242670be124c95a7afb4ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3b90a9a4-5085-45d1-964d-bcee5a8cd9a5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "702731c7389cca9f42abeb215e36052bd354cf96a686cdb18e6c1c8c0ecc1e85", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "According to the 9th Sikh Guru, Tegh Bahadur, the ideal Sikh should have both Shakti (power that resides in the temporal), and Bhakti (spiritual meditative qualities). This was developed into the concept of the \"saint soldier\" by the 10th Sikh Guru, Gobind Singh.The concept of humanity as elaborated by Guru Nanak refines and negates the \"monotheistic concept of self/God\", and \"monotheism becomes almost redundant in the movement and crossings of love\". The human's goal, taught the Sikh gurus, is to end all dualities of \"self and other, I and not-I\", attain the \"attendant balance of separation-fusion, self-other, action-inaction, attachment-detachment, in the course of daily life\".\n\n\n=== Singing and Music ===\nSikhs refer to the hymns of the gurus as Gurbani ('Guru's word'). Shabad Kirtan is the singing of Gurbani. The entire verses of Guru Granth Sahib are written in a form of poetry and rhyme to be recited in thirty-one Ragas of the Classical Indian Music as specified. However, the exponents of these are rarely to be found amongst the Sikhs who are conversant with all the Ragas in the Guru Granth Sahib. Guru Nanak started the Shabad Kirtan tradition and taught that listening to kirtan is a powerful way to achieve tranquility while meditating, and singing of the glories of the Supreme Timeless One (God) with devotion is the most effective way to come in communion with the Supreme Timeless One. The three morning prayers for Sikhs consist of Japji Sahib, Jaap Sahib, and Tav-Prasad Savaiye. Baptised Sikhs (Amritdharis) rise early and meditate, then recite all the Five Banis of Nitnem, before breakfast. Five Banis consists of Jap Ji Sahib, Jaap Sahib, Tav-Prasad Savaiye, Chaupai Sahib, Anand Sahib and recitation of the banis paath is followed by Ard\u0101s in which Sarbat da Bhala principle is taught by Gurus which literally means blessings for everyone, blessings to humankind in good faith without discrimination.\n\n\n=== Remembrance of the Divine Name ===\nA key practice by Sikhs is remembrance of the Naam (divine name) Waheguru. This contemplation is done through N\u0101m Japna (repetition of the divine name) or Naam Simran (remembrance of the divine Name through recitation). The verbal repetition of the name of God or a sacred syllable has been an ancient established practice in religious traditions in India, however, Sikhism developed Naam-simran as an important Bhakti practice.

This, it states, is the primary root of five evil impulses and the cycle of birth and death.Service in Sikhism takes three forms: Tan (physical service, i.e. labor), Man (mental service, such as dedicating your heart for service of others), and Dhan (material service, including financial support). Sikhism stresses kirat kar\u014d: that is \"honest work\".

According to the Tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, states Pashaura Singh (a professor of Sikh studies), \"one must first try all the peaceful means of negotiation in the pursuit of justice\" and if these fail then it is legitimate to \"draw the sword in defense of righteousness\". Sikhism considers \"an attack on dharam is an attack on justice, on righteousness, and on the moral order generally\" and the dharam \"must be defended at all costs\". The divine name is its antidote for pain and vices. Forgiveness is taught as a virtue in Sikhism, yet it also teaches its faithful to shun those with evil intentions and to pick up the sword to fight injustice and religious persecution.Sikhism does not differentiate religious obligations by sex.

The traditions and philosophy of Sikhism were established by ten Gurus from 1469 to 1708. Each Guru added to and reinforced the message taught by the previous, resulting in the creation of the Sikh religion. Guru Nanak was the first Guru and appointed a disciple as successor. Guru Gobind Singh was the final Guru in human form. Before his death, Guru Gobind Singh decreed in 1708, that the Gur\u016b Granth S\u0101hib would be the final and perpetual Guru of the Sikhs.Guru Nanak stated that his Guru is God who is the same from the beginning of time to the end of time. Nanak said to be a God's slave and servant, but maintained that he was only a guide and teacher. Nanak stated that the human Guru is mortal, who is to be respected and loved but not worshipped. When Guru, or Satguru (The True Guru) is used in Gurbani it is often referring to the highest expression of truthfulness.Guru Angad succeeded Guru Nanak. Later, an important phase in the development of Sikhism came with the third successor, Guru Amar Das. Guru Nanak's teachings emphasised the pursuit of salvation; Guru Amar Das began building a cohesive community of followers with initiatives such as sanctioning distinctive ceremonies for birth, marriage, and death. Amar Das also established the manji (comparable to a diocese) system of clerical supervision.Guru Amar Das's successor and son-in-law Guru Ram Das founded the city of Amritsar, which is home of the Harimandir Sahib and regarded widely as the holiest city for all Sikhs. Guru Arjan was arrested by Mughal authorities who were suspicious and hostile to the religious community he was developing. His persecution and death inspired his successors to promote a military and political organization of Sikh communities to defend themselves against the attacks of Mughal forces.\nThe Sikh gurus established a mechanism which allowed the Sikh religion to react as a community to changing circumstances. The sixth guru, Guru Hargobind, was responsible for the creation of the concept of Akal Takht (throne of the timeless one), which serves as the supreme decision-making centre of Sikhism and sits opposite the Harmandir Sahib. The Akal Takht is located in the city of Amritsar. The leader is appointed by the Shiromani Gurdwara Pabandhak Committee (SPGC). The Sarbat \u1e34\u1e96\u0101ls\u0101 (a representative portion of the Khalsa Panth) historically gathers at the Akal Takht on special festivals such as Vaisakhi or Hola Mohalla and when there is a need to discuss matters that affect the entire Sikh nation. A gurmat\u0101 (literally, 'guru's intention') is an order passed by the Sarbat \u1e34\u1e96\u0101ls\u0101 in the presence of the Gur\u016b Granth S\u0101hib. A gurmat\u0101 may only be passed on a subject that affects the fundamental principles of Sikh religion; it is binding upon all Sikhs. The term hukamn\u0101m\u0101 (literally, 'edict' or 'royal order') is often used interchangeably with the term gurmat\u0101. However, a hukamn\u0101m\u0101 formally refers to a hymn from the Gur\u016b Granth S\u0101hib which is given order to Sikhs.The word guru in Sikhism also refers to Akal Purkh (God), and God and guru can sometimes be synonymous in Gurbani (Sikh writings).", "start_char_idx": 16663, "end_char_idx": 19899, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a959f80-a4b3-4111-92ad-e60d3fd11d59": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a959f80-a4b3-4111-92ad-e60d3fd11d59", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "debed2b2-7944-42a3-bcf8-552fa975eea7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "d67285a79ff7b131e10b65914e3d0a6ba77bbd4e73ea0e289767023d9f83f8d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2dac778a-858d-406f-bfe5-8b9eb65b376e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "a54b436f88a2ff6d49d878ebf5e33780caa96f60821fdfd6d1ba16497e44c725", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fc0fbe6b-f3d5-4f75-90b5-bc59c9c41f3f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "82c46faee5f74feef31da8d38be0bf40eed145f0e96aa2583fab933d6e9d632f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Scripture ==\nThere is one primary scripture for the Sikhs: the Gur\u016b Granth S\u0101hib.

Chronologically, however, the \u0100di Granth \u2013 literally, 'First Volume' \u2013 refers to the version of the scripture created by Guru Arjan in 1604. The Gur\u016b Granth S\u0101hib is the final expanded version of the scripture compiled by Guru Gobind Singh. While the Guru Granth Sahib is an unquestioned scripture in Sikhism, another important religious text, the Dasam Granth, does not enjoy universal consensus, but is considered a secondary scripture by many Sikhs.\n\n\n=== Adi Granth ===\n\nThe \u0100di Granth was compiled primarily by Bhai Gurdas under the supervision of Guru Arjan between the years 1603 and 1604. It is written in the Gurmukh\u012b script, which is a descendant of the La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101 script used in the Punjab at that time. The Gurmukh\u012b script was standardised by Guru Angad, the second guru of the Sikhs, for use in the Sikh scriptures and is thought to have been influenced by the \u015a\u0101rad\u0101 and Devan\u0101gar\u012b scripts. An authoritative scripture was created to protect the integrity of hymns and teachings of the Sikh Gurus, and thirteen Hindu and two Muslim bhagats of the Bhakti movement sant tradition in medieval India. The thirteen Hindu bhagats whose teachings were entered into the text included Ramananda, Namdev, Pipa, Ravidas, Beni, Bhikhan, Dhanna, Jaidev, Parmanand, Sadhana, Sain, Sur, Trilochan, while the two Muslim bhagats were Kabir and Sufi saint Farid. However, the bhagats in context often spoke of transcending their religious labels, Kabir often attributed to being a Muslim states in the Adi Granth, \"I am not Hindu nor Muslim.\" The Gurus following on this message taught that different methods of devotion are for the same infinite God.\n\n\n=== Guru Granth Sahib ===\n\nThe Guru Granth Sahib is the holy scripture of the Sikhs, and is regarded as the living Guru.\n\n\n==== Compilation ====\nThe Guru Granth started as a volume of Guru Nanak's poetic compositions. Prior to his death, he passed on his volume to Guru Angad (Guru 1539\u20131551). The final version of the Gur\u016b Granth S\u0101hib was compiled by Guru Gobind Singh in 1678. It consists of the original \u0100di Granth with the addition of Guru Tegh Bahadur's hymns. The predominant bulk of Guru Granth Sahib is compositions by seven Sikh Gurus \u2013 Guru Nanak, Guru Angad, Guru Amar Das, Guru Ram Das, Guru Arjan, Guru Teg Bahadur and Guru Gobind Singh. It also contains the traditions and teachings of thirteen Hindu Bhakti movement sants (saints) such as Ramananda, Namdev among others, and two Muslim saints namely Kabir and the Sufi Sheikh Farid.The text comprises 6,000 \u015babads (line compositions), which are poetically rendered and set to rhythmic ancient north Indian classical music.

The Granth is revered as eternal gurb\u0101n\u012b and the spiritual authority.The copies of the Guru Granth Sahib are not regarded as material objects, but as living subjects which are alive. According to Myrvold, the Sikh scripture is treated with respect like a living person, in a manner similar to the Gospel in early Christian worship. Old copies of the Sikh scripture are not thrown away, rather funerary services are performed.In India the Guru Granth Sahib is even officially recognised by the Supreme Court of India as a judicial person which can receive donations and own land.

It also refers to the spiritual concepts in Hinduism (Ishvara, Bhagavan, Brahman) and the concept of God in Islam (Allah) to assert that these are just \"alternate names for the Almighty One\".While the Guru Granth Sahib acknowledges the Vedas, Puranas and Quran, it does not imply a syncretic bridge between Hinduism and Islam, but emphasises focusing on nitnem banis like Japu (repeating mantra of the divine Name of God \u2013 Waheguru), instead of Muslim practices such as circumcision or praying by prostrating on the ground to God in a specific direction, or Hindu rituals such as wearing thread.\n\n\n=== Dasam Granth ===\n\nThe Dasam Granth is a scripture of Sikhs which contains texts attributed to Guru Gobind Singh. Scholars, on the other hand, attribute the work to after the Guru's death, being authored by an unknown poet.  The Dasam Granth is important to a great number of Sikhs, however it does not have the same authority as the Guru Granth Sahib. Some compositions of the Dasam Granth like Jaap Sahib, (Amrit Savaiye), and Benti Chaupai are part of the daily prayers (Nitnem) for Sikhs. The first verse of the ard\u0101s prayer is from Chandi di Var. The Dasam Granth is largely versions of Hindu mythology from the Puranas, secular stories from a variety of sources called Charitro Pakhyan \u2013 tales to protect careless men from perils of lust.Many versions of Dasam Granth exist, and the authenticity of the Dasam Granth has in modern times become one of the most debated topics within Sikhism. The Akali Nihangs consider the Dasam and Sarbloh Granth as extensions of the Guru Granth Sahib. The text played a significant role in Sikh history, but in modern times parts of the text have seen antipathy and discussion among Sikhs.\n\n\n=== Sarbloh Granth ===\nThe Sarbloh Granth is a scripture containing 6,500 poetic stanzas traditionally attributed to Guru Gobind Singh. Scholars, on the other hand, attribute the work to after the Guru's death, being authored by an unknown poet. Verses from the Sarbloh Granth. This scripture contains, alongside various topics, the Sikh Art and Laws of War. This scripture is largely revered by Akali Nihangs with many non-Nihang Sikhs rejecting it as an authentic work of the 10th Guru. According to Harbans Singh the authenticity of the work is rejected on the grounds of its writing style and mastery of poetry not matching up with Guru Gobind Singh's Dasam Granth work. Also, the text makes mention of a work composed in 1719, much after the death of the Guru Gobind Singh. W. H.

There are many gurdwaras prominently constructed and maintained across India, as well as in almost every nation where Sikhs reside. Gurdwaras are open to all, regardless of religion, background, caste, or race.Worship in a gurdwara consists chiefly of the singing of passages from the scripture.

Historically, these festivals have been based on the moon calendar Bikrami calendar. In 2003, the SGPC, the Sikh organisation in charge of upkeep of the historical gurdwaras of Punjab, adopted Nanakshahi calendar. The new calendar is highly controversial among Sikhs and is not universally accepted. Sikh festivals include the following:\n\nVaisakhi which includes Parades and Nagar Kirtan and occurs on 13 April or 14 April. Sikhs celebrate it because on this day, which fell on 30 March 1699, the tenth Guru, Gobind Singh, inaugurated the Khalsa, the 11th body of Guru Granth Sahib and leader of Sikhs until eternity.Nagar Kirtan involves the processional singing of holy hymns throughout a community. While practiced at any time, it is customary in the month of Visakhi (or Vaisakhi). Traditionally, the procession is led by the saffron-robed Panj Piare (the five beloved of the Guru), who are followed by the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy Sikh scripture, which is placed on a float.\nBand Chor Diwas has been another important Sikh festival in its history. In recent years, instead of Diwali, the post-2003 calendar released by SGPC has named it the Bandi Chhor Divas. Sikhs celebrate Guru Hargobind's release from the Gwalior Fort, with several innocent Rajas (kings) who were also imprisoned by Mughal Emperor Jahangir in 1619. This day continues to be commemorated on the same day of Hindu festival of Diwali, with lights, fireworks and festivities.\nHola Mohalla is a tradition started by Guru Gobind Singh. It starts the day after Sikhs celebrate Holi, sometimes referred to as Hola. Guru Gobind Singh modified Holi with a three-day Hola Mohalla extension festival of martial arts. The extension started the day after the Holi festival in Anandpur Sahib, where Sikh soldiers would train in mock battles, compete in horsemanship, athletics, archery and military exercises.\nGurpurbs are celebrations or commemorations based on the lives of the Sikh Gurus. They tend to be either birthdays or celebrations of Sikh martyrdom. All ten Gurus have Gurpurbs on the Nanakshahi calendar, but it is Guru Nanak and Guru Gobind Singh who have a gurpurb that is widely celebrated in Gurdwaras and Sikh homes.

The Hola Mohalla around the festival of Holi, for example, is a ceremonial and customary gathering every year in Anandpur Sahib attracting over 100,000 Sikhs. Major Sikh temples feature a sarovar where some Sikhs take a customary dip. Some take home the sacred water of the tank particularly for sick friends and relatives, believing that the waters of such sacred sites have restorative powers and the ability to purify one's karma. The various Gurus of Sikhism have had different approaches to pilgrimage.Upon a child's birth, the Guru Granth Sahib is opened at a random point and the child is named using the first letter on the top left hand corner of the left page.

During this ceremony, sweetened water is stirred with a double-edged sword while liturgical prayers are sung; it is offered to the initiating Sikh, who ritually drinks it. Many Sikhs are not formally and fully initiated, as they do not undergo this ceremony, but do adhere to some components of Sikhism and identify as Sikhs. The initiated Sikh, who is believed to be reborn, is referred to as Amritdhari or Khalsa Sikh, while those who are not initiated or baptised are referred to as Kesdhari or Sahajdhari Sikhs.The first time that this ceremony took place was on Vaisakhi, which fell on 30 March 1699 at Anandpur Sahib in Punjab. It was on that occasion that Gobind Singh baptised the Pa\u00f1j Pi\u0101r\u0113 \u2013 the five beloved ones, who in turn baptised Guru Gobind Singh himself.

Guru Nanak (1469\u20131539), the founder of Sikhism, was born in the village of R\u0101i Bh\u014di d\u012b Talwand\u012b, now called Nankana Sahib (in present-day Pakistan). His parents were Punjabi Khatri Hindus. According to the hagiography Puratan Janamsakhi composed more than two centuries after his death and probably based on oral tradition, Nanak as a boy was fascinated by religion and spiritual matters, spending time with wandering ascetics and holy men. His friend was Mardana, a Muslim. Together they would sing devotional songs all night in front of the public, and bathe in the river in the morning. One day, at the usual bath, Nanak went missing and his family feared he had drowned. Three days later he returned home, and declared: \"There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim\" (\"n\u0101 k\u014di hind\u016b n\u0101 k\u014di musalm\u0101n\"). Thereafter, Nanak started preaching his ideas that form the tenets of Sikhism. In 1526, Guru Nanak at age 50, started a small commune in Kartarpur and his disciples came to be known as Sikhs. Although the exact account of his itinerary is disputed, hagiographic accounts state he made five major journeys, spanning thousands of miles: the first tour being east towards Bengal and Assam; the second south towards Andhra and Tamil Nadu; the third north to Kashmir, Ladakh, and Mount Sumeru in Tibet; and the fourth to Baghdad. In his last and final tour, he returned to the banks of the Ravi River to end his days.There are two competing theories on Guru Nanak's teachings. One, according to Cole and Sambhi, is based on hagiographical Janamsakhis, and states that Nanak's teachings and Sikhism were a revelation from God, and not a social protest movement nor any attempt to reconcile Hinduism and Islam in the 15th century. The other states that Nanak was a guru. According to Singha, \"Sikhism does not subscribe to the theory of incarnation or the concept of prophethood. But it has a pivotal concept of Guru. He is not an incarnation of God, not even a prophet. He is an illumined soul.\" The second theory continues that hagiographical Janamsakhis were not written by Nanak, but by later followers without regard for historical accuracy, and contain numerous legends and myths created to show respect for Nanak. The term revelation, clarify Cole and Sambhi, in Sikhism is not limited to the teachings of Nanak, but is extended to all Sikh gurus, as well as the words of past, present and future men and women, who possess divine knowledge intuitively through meditation. The Sikh revelations include the words of non-Sikh bhagats, some who lived and died before the birth of Nanak, and whose teachings are part of the Sikh scriptures. The Adi Granth and successive Sikh gurus repeatedly emphasised, states Mandair, that Sikhism is \"not about hearing voices from God, but it is about changing the nature of the human mind, and anyone can achieve direct experience and spiritual perfection at any time\".", "start_char_idx": 36272, "end_char_idx": 39232, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6294adc6-b226-4e98-8c5f-33e8f249ba5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "6294adc6-b226-4e98-8c5f-33e8f249ba5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "debed2b2-7944-42a3-bcf8-552fa975eea7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "d67285a79ff7b131e10b65914e3d0a6ba77bbd4e73ea0e289767023d9f83f8d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d00248d2-f56b-40b7-868f-abd8d5e0fbf9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "013f9c98cdeb51ef85a8bd92704d64be2c42143834b4ab557ccb56016fe3ea56", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2726d941-203a-4108-a214-54e7470d9c79", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5230fc1cf1771af72d591b1ef6195ad0b49c2519840fca7d164ae41b5a2c3fb9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Historical influences ===\nThe roots of the Sikh tradition are, states Louis Fenech, perhaps in the Sant-tradition of India whose ideology grew to become the Bhakti tradition. Furthermore, adds Fenech:\nFew Sikhs would mention these Indic texts and ideologies in the same breadth as the Sikh tradition, let alone trace elements of their tradition to this chronological and ideological point, despite the fact that the Indic mythology permeates the Sikh sacred canon, the Guru Granth Sahib, and the secondary canon, the Dasam Granth ... and adds delicate nuance and substance to the sacred symbolic universe of the Sikhs of today and of their past ancestors.\nThe development of Sikhism was influenced by the Bhakti movement; however, Sikhism was not simply an extension of the Bhakti movement. Sikhism, for instance, disagreed with some of the views of Bhakti saints Kabir and Ravidas. Sikhism developed while the region was being ruled by the Mughal Empire. Two of the Sikh Gurus, Guru Arjan and Guru Tegh Bahadur, refused to convert to Islam and were tortured and executed by the Mughal rulers. The Islamic era persecution of Sikhs triggered the founding of the Khalsa, as an order for freedom of conscience and religion. A Sikh is expected to embody the qualities of a \"Sant-Sip\u0101h\u012b\" \u2013  a saint-soldier.\n\n\n=== Growth of Sikhism ===\nAfter its inception, Sikhism grew as it gained converts among Hindus and Muslims in the Punjab region. In 1539, Guru Nanak chose his disciple Lahi\u1e47\u0101 as a successor to the Guruship rather than either of his sons. Lahi\u1e47\u0101 was named Guru Angad and became the second Guru of the Sikhs. Nanak conferred his choice at the town of Kartarpur on the banks of the river Ravi. Sri Chand, Guru Nanak's son was also a religious man, and continued his own commune of Sikhs. His followers came to be known as the Udasi Sikhs, the first parallel sect of Sikhism that formed in Sikh history. The Udasis believe that the Guruship should have gone to Sri Chand, since he was a man of pious habits in addition to being Nanak's son.Guru Angad, before joining Guru Nanak's commune, worked as a pujari (priest) and religious teacher centered around Hindu goddess Durga. On Nanak's advice, Guru Angad moved from Kartarpur to Khadur, where his wife Khivi and children were living, until he was able to bridge the divide between his followers and the Udasis. Guru Angad continued the work started by Guru Nanak and is widely credited for standardising the Gurmukh\u012b script as used in the sacred scripture of the Sikhs.Guru Amar Das became the third Sikh Guru in 1552 at the age of 73. He adhered to the Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism for much of his life, before joining the commune of Guru Angad. Goindval became an important centre for Sikhism during the Guruship of Guru Amar Das. He was a reformer, and discouraged veiling of women's faces (a Muslim custom) as well as sati (a Hindu custom). He encouraged the Kshatriya people to fight in order to protect people and for the sake of justice, stating this is Dharma.", "start_char_idx": 39235, "end_char_idx": 42264, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2726d941-203a-4108-a214-54e7470d9c79": {"__data__": {"id_": "2726d941-203a-4108-a214-54e7470d9c79", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "debed2b2-7944-42a3-bcf8-552fa975eea7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "d67285a79ff7b131e10b65914e3d0a6ba77bbd4e73ea0e289767023d9f83f8d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6294adc6-b226-4e98-8c5f-33e8f249ba5b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "078d0c9ad362f31dc8a16d09fa4af656f35362054fa8b5654eba21f652268dc8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ccc272b1-6863-48b4-87b2-ad9802e9b163", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e060e4444a13ae766bbac26c1b0a2357a1022edb61eee94582a7b05e35f63cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Goindval became an important centre for Sikhism during the Guruship of Guru Amar Das. He was a reformer, and discouraged veiling of women's faces (a Muslim custom) as well as sati (a Hindu custom). He encouraged the Kshatriya people to fight in order to protect people and for the sake of justice, stating this is Dharma. Guru Amar Das started the tradition of appointing manji (zones of religious administration with an appointed chief called sangatias), introduced the dasvandh (tithe) system of revenue collection in the name of Guru and as pooled community religious resource, and the famed langar tradition of Sikhism where anyone, without discrimination of any kind, could get a free meal in a communal seating. The collection of revenue from Sikhs through regional appointees helped Sikhism grow.Guru Amar Das named his disciple and son-in-law J\u0113\u1e6dh\u0101 as the next Guru, who came to be known as Guru Ram Das. The new Guru faced hostilities from the sons of Guru Amar Das and therefore shifted his official base to lands identified by Guru Amar Das as Guru-ka-Chak. He moved his commune of Sikhs there and the place then was called Ramdaspur, after him. This city grew and later became Amritsar \u2013 the holiest city of Sikhism. Guru Ram Das expanded the manji organization for clerical appointments in Sikh temples, and for revenue collections to theologically and economically support the Sikh movement.In 1581, Guru Arjan \u2013 the youngest son of Guru Ram Das, became the fifth Guru of the Sikhs. The choice of successor, as throughout most of the history of Sikh Guru successions, led to disputes and internal divisions among the Sikhs. The elder son of Guru Ram Das named Prithi Chand is remembered in the Sikh tradition as vehemently opposing Guru Arjan, creating a faction Sikh community which the Sikhs following Guru Arjan called as Minaas (literally, \"scoundrels\").Guru Arjan is remembered in the Sikh for many things. He built the first Harimandir Sahib (later to become the Golden Temple). He was a poet and created the first edition of Sikh sacred text known as the \u0100di Granth (literally \"the first book\") and included the writings of the first five Gurus and other enlightened 13 Hindu and 2 Muslim Sufi saints. In 1606, he was tortured and killed by the Mughal emperor Jahangir, for refusing to convert to Islam. His martyrdom is considered a watershed event in the history of Sikhism.\n\n\n=== Political advancement ===\nAfter the martyrdom of Guru Arjan, his son Guru Hargobind at age eleven became the sixth Guru of the Sikhs, and Sikhism dramatically evolved to become a political movement in addition to being religious. Guru Hargobind carried two swords, calling one spiritual and the other for temporal purpose (known as m\u012br\u012b and p\u012br\u012b in Sikhism). According to the Sikh tradition, Guru Arjan asked his son Hargobind to start a military tradition to protect the Sikh people and always keep himself surrounded by armed Sikhs. The building of an armed Sikh militia began with Guru Hargobind. Guru Hargobind was soon arrested by the Mughals and kept in jail in Gwalior.

Guru Hargobind was soon arrested by the Mughals and kept in jail in Gwalior. It is unclear how many years he served in prison, with different texts stating it to be between 2 and 12. He married three women, built a fort to defend Ramdaspur and created a formal court called Akal Takht, now the highest Khalsa Sikh religious authority.In 1644, Guru Hargobind named his grandson Har Rai as the Guru. The Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan attempted political means to undermine the Sikh tradition, by dividing and influencing the succession. The Mughal ruler gave land grants to Dhir Mal, a grandson of Guru Hargobind living in Kartarpur, and attempted to encourage Sikhs to recognise Dhir Mal as the rightful successor to Guru Hargobind. Dhir Mal issued statements in favour of the Mughal state, and critical of his grandfather Guru Arjan. Guru Hargobind rejected Dhir Mal, the latter refused to give up the original version of the Adi Granth he had, and the Sikh community was divided.Guru Har Rai is famed to have met Dara Shikoh during a time Dara Shikoh and his younger brother Aurangzeb were in a bitter succession fight. Aurangzeb summoned Guru Har Rai, who refused to go and sent his elder son Ram Rai instead. The emperor found a verse in the Sikh scripture insulting to Muslims, and Ram Rai agreed it was a mistake then changed it. Ram Rai thus pleased Aurangzeb, but displeased Guru Har Rai who excommunicated his elder son. He nominated his younger son Guru Har Krishan to succeed him in 1661. Aurangzeb responded by granting Ram Rai a jagir (land grant). Ram Rai founded a town there and enjoyed Aurangzeb's patronage; the town came to be known as Dehradun, after Dehra referring to Ram Rai's shrine. Sikhs who followed Ram Rai came to be known as Ramraiya Sikhs. However, according to rough estimates, there are around 120\u2013150 million (12\u201315 crore) Guru Har Krishan became the eighth Guru at the age of five, and died of smallpox before reaching the age of eight. No hymns composed by these three Gurus are included in the Guru Granth Sahib.Guru Tegh Bahadur, the uncle of Guru Har Krishan, became Guru in 1665. Tegh Bahadur resisted the forced conversions of Kashmiri Pandits and non-Muslims to Islam, and was publicly beheaded in 1675 on the orders of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in Delhi for refusing to convert to Islam. His beheading traumatized the Sikhs. His body was cremated in Delhi, the head was carried secretively by Sikhs and cremated in Anandpur. He was succeeded by his son, Gobind Rai, who militarised his followers by creating the Khalsa in 1699, and baptising the Pa\u00f1j Pi\u0101r\u0113.

It created a community that combines its spiritual purpose and goals with political and military duties. Shortly before his death, Guru Gobind Singh proclaimed the Gur\u016b Granth S\u0101hib (the Sikh Holy Scripture) to be the ultimate spiritual authority for the Sikhs.The Sikh Khalsa's rise to power began in the 17th century during a time of growing militancy against Mughal rule. The creation of a Sikh Empire began when Guru Gobind Singh sent a Sikh general, Banda Singh Bahadur, to fight the Mughal rulers of India and those who had committed atrocities against Pir Buddhu Shah. Banda Singh advanced his army towards the main Muslim Mughal city of Sirhind and, following the instructions of the Guru, punished all the culprits. Soon after the invasion of Sirhind, while resting in his chamber after the Rehras prayer Guru Gobind Singh was stabbed by a Pathan assassin hired by Mughals. Gobind Singh killed the attacker with his sword. Though a European surgeon stitched the Guru's wound, the wound re-opened as the Guru tugged at a hard strong bow after a few days, causing profuse bleeding that led to Gobind Singh's death.After the Guru's death, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur became the commander-in-chief of the Khalsa. He organised the civilian rebellion and abolished or halted the Zamindari system in time he was active and gave the farmers proprietorship of their own land. Banda Singh was executed by the emperor Farrukh Siyar after refusing the offer of a pardon if he converted to Islam. The confederacy of Sikh warrior bands known as misls emerged, but these fought between themselves. Ranjit Singh achieved a series of military victories and created a Sikh Empire in 1799.The Sikh empire, with its capital in Lahore, spread over almost 200,000 square miles (520,000 square kilometres) comprising what is now northwestern Indian subcontinent. The Sikh Empire entered into a treaty with the colonial British powers, with each side recognizing Sutlej River as the line of control and agreeing not to invade the other side. Ranjit Singh's most lasting legacy was the restoration and expansion of the Harmandir Sahib, most revered Gurudwara of the Sikhs, with marble and gold, from which the popular name of the \"Golden Temple\" is derived. After the death of Ranjit Singh in 1839, the Sikh Empire fell into disorder. Ranjit Singh had failed to establish a lasting structure for Sikh government or stable succession, and the Sikh Empire rapidly declined after his death. Factions divided the Sikhs, and led to Anglo-Sikh wars. The British defeated the confused and demoralised Khalsa forces, then disbanded them into destitution. The youngest son of Ranjit Singh, named Duleep Singh, ultimately succeeded, but he was arrested and exiled after the defeat of Sikh Khalsa.", "start_char_idx": 47409, "end_char_idx": 50689, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "268e4504-a552-4771-8b70-a9cd368c9f9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "268e4504-a552-4771-8b70-a9cd368c9f9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "debed2b2-7944-42a3-bcf8-552fa975eea7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "d67285a79ff7b131e10b65914e3d0a6ba77bbd4e73ea0e289767023d9f83f8d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a4e3691c-6ad1-4e4b-a4ee-8d04950d54cd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "cae3a5f68594bc80b1d9d1b32793ec62f47c94ab69d439f47f6b29f4ab331e09", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dc6a54e4-0eef-4b1c-996e-04a4c155824b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "eb8dbce5e4973e78fbe5c8efb1b8a49715c8d2eee7f1ea58141dce99ca181c8b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "==== Singh Sabha movement ====\n\nThe Singh Sabha movement, a movement to revitalize Sikhism, also saw the resurgence of the Khalsa after their defeat in wars with the British - latterly in the Second Anglo-Sikh War - and the subsequent decline and corruption of Sikh institutions during colonial rule, and the proselytization of other faith groups in the Punjab.  It was started in the 1870s, and after a period of interfactional rivalry, united under the Tat Khalsa to reinvigorate Sikh practice and institutions.The last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire, Duleep Singh, converted to Christianity in 1853, a controversial but influential event in Sikh history. Along with his conversion, and after Sikh Empire had been dissolved and the region made a part of the colonial British Empire, proselytising activities of Christians, Brahmo Samajis, Arya Samaj, Muslim Anjuman-i-Islamia and Ahmadiyah sought to convert the Sikhs in northwestern Indian subcontinent into their respective faiths. These developments launched the Singh Sabha Movement.The first meeting of the movement was in the Golden Temple, Amritsar in 1873, and it was largely launched by the Sanatan Sikhs, Gianis, priests, and granthis. Shortly thereafter, Nihang Sikhs began influencing the movement, followed by a sustained campaign by the Tat Khalsa, which had quickly gained dominance by the early 1880s. The movement became a struggle between Sanatan Sikhs and Tat Khalsa in defining and interpreting Sikhism.Sanatan Sikhs led by Khem Singh Bedi \u2013 who claimed to be a direct descendant of Guru Nanak, Avtar Singh Vahiria and others supported a more inclusive approach which considered Sikhism as a reformed tradition of Hinduism, while Tat Khalsa campaigned for an exclusive approach to the Sikh identity, disagreeing with Sanatan Sikhs and seeking to modernize Sikhism. The Sikh Sabha movement expanded in north and northwest Indian subcontinent, leading to more than 100 Singh Sabhas. By the early decades of the 20th century, the influence of Tat Khalsa increased in interpreting the nature of Sikhism and their control over the Sikh Gurdwaras. The Tat Khalsa banished Brahmanical practices including the use of the yagna fire, replaced by the Anand Karaj marriage ceremony in accordance with Sikh scripture, and the idols and the images of Sikh Gurus from the Golden Temple in 1905, traditions which had taken root during the administration of the mahants during the 1800s. They undertook a sustained campaign to standardize how Sikh Gurdwaras looked and ran, while looking to Sikh scriptures and the early Sikh tradition to purify the Sikh identity.The spiritual successors of the Singh Sabha include the Akali movement of the 1920s, as well as the modern-day Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), a gurdwara administration body, and the Akali Dal political party.\n\n\n==== Partition of India ====\nSikhs participated and contributed to the decades-long Indian independence movement in the first half of the 20th century. Ultimately when the British Empire recognized independent India, the land was partitioned into Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan (East and West) in 1947. According to Banga, the partition was a watershed event in Sikh history. The Sikhs had historically lived in northwestern region of Indian subcontinent on both sides of the partition line (\"Radcliffe Line\"). According to Banga and other scholars, the Sikhs had strongly opposed the Muslim League demands and saw it as \"perpetuation of Muslim domination\" and anti-Sikh policies in what just a hundred years before was a part of the Sikh Empire.", "start_char_idx": 50692, "end_char_idx": 54302, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc6a54e4-0eef-4b1c-996e-04a4c155824b": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc6a54e4-0eef-4b1c-996e-04a4c155824b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "debed2b2-7944-42a3-bcf8-552fa975eea7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "d67285a79ff7b131e10b65914e3d0a6ba77bbd4e73ea0e289767023d9f83f8d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "268e4504-a552-4771-8b70-a9cd368c9f9b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "e7dd9b540218ee63e1d8f9bf0431c913569bc7c352583a8e234272137751271c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "363f9304-b8a0-4918-a683-063a587d3aaf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a6873c455731174dea7538e3d9f11ed6bd30d72d59bf62fec5046b4adf1ecf4b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Sikhs had historically lived in northwestern region of Indian subcontinent on both sides of the partition line (\"Radcliffe Line\"). According to Banga and other scholars, the Sikhs had strongly opposed the Muslim League demands and saw it as \"perpetuation of Muslim domination\" and anti-Sikh policies in what just a hundred years before was a part of the Sikh Empire. As such, Sikh organizations, including the Chief Khalsa Dewan and Shiromani Akali Dal led by Master Tara Singh, condemned the Lahore Resolution and the movement to create Pakistan, viewing it as inviting possible persecution; the Sikhs largely thus strongly opposed the partition of India. During the discussions with the colonial authorities, Tara Singh emerged as an important leader who campaigned to prevent the partition of colonial India and for the recognition of Sikhs as a third community.When partition was announced, the newly created line divided the Sikh population. Along with Hindus, Sikhs suffered organized violence and riots against them in West Pakistan. As a result, Sikhs moved en masse to the Indian side, leaving behind their property and holy sites. However, the anti-Sikh violence was not one-sided. As Sikhs moved to the eastern side of the partition line, they engaged in reprisals against Muslims there, forcing them into Pakistan. Before the partition, Sikhs constituted about 15% of the population in West Punjab, the majority being Muslims (55%). The Sikhs were the economic elite in West Punjab, however. They had the largest representation in West Punjab's aristocracy, and there were nearly 700 Gurdwaras and 400 educational institutions that served the interests of the Sikhs. Prior to the partition, there were a series of disputes between the majority Muslims and minority Sikhs, such as on the matters of jhatka versus halal meat, the disputed ownership of Gurdwara Sahidganj in Lahore which Muslims sought as a mosque and Sikhs as a Gurdwara, and the insistence of the provincial Muslim government on switching from Indian Gurmukhi script to Arabic-Persian Nastaliq script in schools. During and after the Simla Conference in June 1945, headed by Lord Wavell, the Sikh leaders initially expressed their desire to be recognized as a third community, but ultimately relegated these demands and sought a United India where Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims would live together, under a Swiss-style constitution. The Muslim League rejected this approach, demanding that the entire Punjab should be granted to Pakistan. The Sikh leaders then sought the original partition instead, and the Congress Working Committee passed a resolution in support of partitioning Punjab and Bengal.\nBetween March and August 1947, a series of riots, arson, plunder of Sikh and property, assassination of Sikh leaders, and killings in Jhelum districts, Rawalpindi, Attock and other places led to Tara Singh calling the situation in Punjab a \"civil war\", while Lord Mountbatten stated \"civil war preparations were going on.\" The riots had triggered the early waves of migration in April, with some 20,000 people leaving northwest Punjab and moving to Patiala. In Rawalpindi, 40,000 people became homeless. The Sikh leaders made desperate petitions, but all religious communities were suffering in the political turmoil. Sikhs constituted only 4 million out of a total of 28 million in Punjab, and 6 million out of nearly 400 million in India; they did not constitute the majority, not even in a single district.When the partition line was formally announced in August 1947, the violence was unprecedented, with Sikhs being one of the most affected religious community both in terms of deaths, as well as property loss, injury, trauma and disruption.", "start_char_idx": 53932, "end_char_idx": 57658, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "363f9304-b8a0-4918-a683-063a587d3aaf": {"__data__": {"id_": "363f9304-b8a0-4918-a683-063a587d3aaf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "debed2b2-7944-42a3-bcf8-552fa975eea7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "d67285a79ff7b131e10b65914e3d0a6ba77bbd4e73ea0e289767023d9f83f8d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dc6a54e4-0eef-4b1c-996e-04a4c155824b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "ea079bac7fab63c7a83bbe073f31987d575b9d39b9e249b8cd148eac9966a259", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d6c1f036-b353-4a00-9b41-de24411c29b9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7232d618df62ecb247d8769c47b42028f6764e1f4c0de31487acb78158397178", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Sikhs and Muslims were both victims and perpetrators of retaliatory violence against each other.

Sikh and Hindu refugees from Pakistan flooded into India, Muslim refugees from India flooded into Pakistan, each into their new homeland.\n\n\n==== Khalistan ====\nIn 1940, a few Sikhs such as the victims of Komagata Maru in Canada proposed the idea of Khalistan as a buffer state between an independent India and what would become Pakistan. These leaders, however, were largely ignored. The early 1980s witnessed some Sikh groups seeking an independent nation named Khalistan carved out from India and Pakistan. The Golden Temple and Akal Takht were occupied by various militant groups in 1982. These included the Dharam Yudh Morcha led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the Babbar Khalsa, the AISSF and the National Council of Khalistan. Between 1982 and 1983, there were Anandpur Resolution demand-related terrorist attacks against civilians in parts of India. By late 1983, the Bhindranwale led group had begun to build bunkers and observations posts in and around the Golden Temple, with militants involved in weapons training. In June 1984, the then Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi ordered Indian Army to begin Operation Blue Star against the militants. The fierce engagement took place in the precincts of Darbar Sahib and resulted in many deaths, including Bhindranwale, the destruction of the Sikh Reference Library, which was considered a national treasure that contained over a thousand rare manuscripts, and destroyed Akal Takht. Numerous soldiers, civilians and militants died in the cross fire. Within days of the Operation Bluestar, some 2,000 Sikh soldiers in India mutinied and attempted to reach Amritsar to liberate the Golden Temple. Within six months, on 31 October 1984, Indira Gandhi's Sikh bodyguards Satwant and Beant Singh assassinated her. The assassination triggered the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. According to Donald Horowitz, while anti-Sikh riots led to much damage and deaths, many serious provocations by militants also failed to trigger ethnic violence in many cases throughout the 1980s. The Sikhs and their neighbors, for most part, ignored attempts to provoke riots and communal strife.", "start_char_idx": 57659, "end_char_idx": 60391, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d6c1f036-b353-4a00-9b41-de24411c29b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "d6c1f036-b353-4a00-9b41-de24411c29b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "debed2b2-7944-42a3-bcf8-552fa975eea7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "d67285a79ff7b131e10b65914e3d0a6ba77bbd4e73ea0e289767023d9f83f8d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "363f9304-b8a0-4918-a683-063a587d3aaf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "71ffad4967477470f30caf32503e1e928463808b3944d200b2fb36dc03ddacca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c23cd97f-51bf-4c91-bbfc-74f403342077", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1cb61e9cf22a3f01fd2201f779706de56d072ab9303cb83a436383137251a8c3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Sikh people ==\n\nEstimates as of 2019 state that Sikhism has some 25\u201330 million followers worldwide.

British Columbia, Manitoba, and Yukon hold the distinction of being three of the only four administrative divisions in the world with Sikhism as the second-most followed religion among the population.Prior to the 1947 partition of British India, millions of Sikhs lived in what later became Pakistan. Likewise, Sikhism was founded in what is now Pakistan, and some of the Gurus were born near Lahore and in other parts of Pakistan. During the partition, Sikhs and Hindus left the newly created Muslim-majority Pakistan and mostly moved to Hindu-majority India\u2014with some moving to Muslim-majority Afghanistan\u2014while numerous Muslims in India moved to Pakistan. According to 2017 news reports, only about 20,000 Sikhs remain in Pakistan, and their population is dwindling (0.01% of the country's estimated 200 million population).\n\n\n=== Sikh sects ===\n\nSikh sects are sub-traditions within Sikhism that believe in an alternate lineage of gurus, or have a different interpretation of the Sikh scriptures, or believe in following a living guru, or hold other concepts that differ from the orthodox Khalsa Sikhs. The major historic sects of Sikhism have included Udasi, Nirmala, Nanakpanthi, Khalsa, Sahajdhari, Namdhari Kuka, Nirankari, and Sarvaria.Sikhs originally had only 5 orders, or sampradas (not to be confused as deviant sects). These include:\nNihangs - the Sikh Panth's warriors or armed troops. There are two main groups within this order: Buddha Dal, or the army of veterans, and Tarna Dal, or the army of youth. There are other smaller sub-orders connected to these two. The president of Buddha Dal, previously always served as the president of the Akaal Takht, which has jurisdiction over all things pertaining to the Akaali Nihang order. Theoretically, the religion is the property of Baba Fateh Singh, Sahibzada (son) of the tenth Guru.\nNirmalas \u2013 scholars. Composed texts as well as traditionally studying a wide range of Indian and some non-Indian literature. They converse with other Dharmik pathways as well. The 10th Guru also institutionalized them.

There are further sub-orders with these two orders.Udasis \u2013 an ascetic group that historically looked after Gurdwaras and carried out missionary activity. Although not promoting it to others, certain of their practices depart from the majority of Sikh beliefs. Baba Sri Chand, the eldest Sahibzada (son) of the first Guru, Guru Nanak Dev, founded the order.

Later on Ramraiya sect, founded by Ram Rai, grew in Dehradun with the patronage of Aurangzeb. Many splintered Sikh communities formed during the Mughal Empire era. Some of these sects were financially and administratively supported by the Mughal rulers in the hopes of gaining a more favorable and compliant citizenry.After the collapse of Mughal Empire, and particularly during the rule of Ranjit Singh, Udasi Sikhs protected Sikh shrines, preserved the Sikh scripture and rebuilt those that were desecrated or destroyed during the Muslim\u2013Sikh wars. However, Udasi Sikhs kept idols and images inside these Sikh temples. In the 19th century, Namdharis and Nirankaris sects were formed in Sikhism, seeking to reform and return to what each believed was the pure form of Sikhism.All these sects differ from Khalsa orthodox Sikhs in their beliefs and practices, such as continuing to solemnize their weddings around fire and being strictly vegetarian. Many accept the concept of living Gurus such as Guru Baba Dyal Singh. The Nirankari sect, though unorthodox, was influential in shaping the views of Tat Khalsa and the contemporary-era Sikh beliefs and practices. Another significant Sikh sect of the 19th century was the Radhasoami movement in Punjab led by Baba Shiv Dyal.

Other contemporary era Sikhs sects include the 3HO, formed in 1971, which exists outside India, particularly in North America and Europe.\n\n\n=== Sikh castes ===\nAccording to Surinder Jodhka, the state of Punjab with a Sikh majority has the \"largest proportion of scheduled caste population in India\". Although decried by Sikhism, Sikhs have practiced a caste system. The system, along with untouchability, has been more common in rural parts of Punjab. The landowning dominant Sikh castes, states Jodhka, \"have not shed all their prejudices against the lower castes or dalits; while dalits would be allowed entry into the village gurdwaras they would not be permitted to cook or serve langar.\" The Sikh dalits of Punjab have tried to build their own gurdwara, other local level institutions and sought better material circumstances and dignity. According to Jodhka, due to economic mobility in contemporary Punjab, castes no longer mean an inherited occupation, nor are work relations tied to a single location.\nIn 1953, the government of India acceded to the demands of the Sikh leader, Master Tara Singh, to include Sikh Dalit castes in the list of scheduled castes. In the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, 20 of the 140 seats are reserved for low-caste Sikhs.Over 60% of Sikhs belong to the Jat caste, which is an agrarian caste. Despite being very small in numbers, the mercantile Khatri and Arora castes wield considerable influence within the Sikh community. Other common Sikh castes include Sainis, Ramgarhias (artisans), Brahmins, Ahluwalias (formerly brewers), Rajputs, Rai Sikh (Rai), Kambojs (rural caste), Labanas, Kumhars and the two Dalit castes, known in Sikh terminology as the Mazhabis (the Chuhras) and the Ravidasias (the Chamars).", "start_char_idx": 66145, "end_char_idx": 68013, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bdf7596f-cd01-4a5e-b929-8e0bcb5b3890": {"__data__": {"id_": "bdf7596f-cd01-4a5e-b929-8e0bcb5b3890", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "debed2b2-7944-42a3-bcf8-552fa975eea7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "d67285a79ff7b131e10b65914e3d0a6ba77bbd4e73ea0e289767023d9f83f8d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "44548223-3cf5-4af2-8dd0-010af5a12430", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Sikkim.txt", "file_name": "Sikkim.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75000, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "98f7e4191e93bcb0541d903c1c98cf57a27b563e7f6d5e8bda76e67614629240", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "df73e16c-fc82-4ed3-8b13-7a7849a4449f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "84697d810c4a4bcdfa610350dac70dd89d3b48ff5793e82c4062487621b62551", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Sikh diaspora ===\n\nSikhism is the fifth-largest amongst the world religions, and one of the youngest. Worldwide, there are 30 million Sikhs, which makes up 0.4% of the world's population. Approximately 75% of Sikhs live in Punjab, where they constitute 57.7% of the state's population. Large communities of Sikhs migrate to the neighboring states such as Indian State of Haryana which is home to the second largest Sikh population in India with 1.1 million Sikhs as per 2001 census, and large immigrant communities of Sikhs can be found across India. However, Sikhs only comprise about 1.7% of the Indian population.Most Sikhs outside India live in the core Anglosphere, with 771,790 in Canada (2.1% Sikh), 524,140 in the United Kingdom (0.9% Sikh), 280,000 in the United States (0.1% Sikh), 210,400 in Australia (0.8% Sikh), and 40,908 in New Zealand (0.9% Sikh). While these communities are over 125 years old, most Sikhs in the West are first, second, or third-generation immigrants. As of the 2021 Canadian Census, more than half of Canada's Sikhs can be found in one of four cities: Brampton (163,260), Surrey (154,415), Calgary (49,465), and Abbotsford (38,395). Brampton, Surrey, and Abbotsford are 25.1% Sikh, 27.4% Sikh, and 25.5% Sikh, respectively. Gurdwaras, newspapers, radio stations, and markets cater to these large, multi-generational Sikh Canadian groups. Sikh festivals such as Vaisakhi and Bandi Chhor are celebrated in those Canadian cities by the largest groups of followers in the world outside the Punjab.Sikhs also migrated to East Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. These communities developed as Sikhs migrated out of Punjab to fill in gaps in imperial labour markets. Smaller populations of Sikhs are found within many countries in Western Europe, especially Italy, as well as other nations such as Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong, Fiji, Nepal, China, Afghanistan, and Iran.\n\n\n== Prohibitions in Sikhism ==\n\nThese prohibitions are strictly followed by initiated Khalsa Sikhs who have undergone baptism. While the Sikh gurus did not enforce religion and did not believe in forcing people to follow any particular religion in general, the Sikh community does encourage all people to become better individuals by following the Guru's Way (Gur-mat), as opposed to living life without the Guru's code of disciple (Man-mat):4 major transgressions:\nHair removal \u2013 Hair cutting, trimming, removing, shaving, plucking, threading, dyeing, or any other alteration from any body part is strictly forbidden.\nEating Kutha meat. This is the absolute minimum required by all initiated Sikhs. Many Sikhs refrain from eating non-vegetarian food, and believe all should follow this diet. This is due to various social, cultural, political, and familial aspects. As such, there has always been major disagreement among Sikhs over the issue of eating non-vegetarian food. Sikhs following the rahit (code of conduct) of the Damdami Taksal & AKJ also subscribe to this view. The Akali Nihangs have traditionally eaten meat and are famous for performing Jhatka.

Nonetheless, all Sikhs agree with the minimum consensus that meat slaughtered via the Muslim (Halal) or Jewish (Shechita) methods is strictly against Sikh dogma and principles. The Akal Takht represents the final authority on controversial issues concerning the Sikh Panth (community or collective). The Hukamnama (edict or clarification), issued by Akal Takht Jathedar Sadhu Singh Bhaura dated 15 February 1980, states that eating meat does not go against the code of conduct of the Sikhs.

Consumption of tobacco and intoxicants (hemp, opium, liquor, narcotics, cocaine, etc.) is not allowed. Cannabis is generally prohibited, but ritually consumed in edible form by some Sikhs. Some Sikh groups, like the Damdami Taksal, are even opposed to drinking caffeine in Indian tea. Indian tea is almost always served in Sikh Gurudwaras around the world.

It was traditionally crushed and consumed as a liquid, especially during festivals like Hola Mohalla. It is never smoked, as this practice is forbidden in Sikhism. In 2001, Jathedar Santa Singh, the leader of Budha Dal, along with 20 chiefs of Nihang sects, refused to accept the ban on consumption of shaheedi degh by the apex Sikh clergy of Akal Takht \u2013 in order to preserve their traditional practices.

TN) is the southernmost state of India. The tenth largest Indian state by area and the sixth largest by population, Tamil Nadu is the home of the Tamil people, who speak the Tamil language, one of the longest surviving classical languages and serves as its official language. The capital and largest city is Chennai.\nLocated on the south-eastern coast of the Indian peninsula, Tamil Nadu is straddled by the Western Ghats and Deccan Plateau in the west, the Eastern Ghats in the north, the Eastern Coastal Plains lining the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait to the south-east, the Laccadive Sea at the southern cape of the peninsula, with the river Kaveri bisecting the state. Politically, Tamil Nadu is bound by the Indian states of Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, and the union territory of Puducherry and shares an international maritime border with the Northern Province of Sri Lanka at Pamban Island.\nArchaeological evidence points to Tamil Nadu being inhabited for more than 400 millennia and has more than 5,500 years of continuous cultural history. Historically, the Tamilakam region was inhabited by Tamil-speaking Dravidian people and was ruled by several regimes over centuries, such as the Sangam era triumverate of the Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas, the Pallavas (3rd\u20139th century CE), and the later Vijayanagara Empire (14th\u201317th century CE). European colonization began with establishing trade ports in the 17th century, with the British controlling much of South India as the Madras Presidency for two centuries before the Indian Independence in 1947. After independence, the region became the Madras State of the Republic of India and was further re-organized when states were redrawn linguistically in 1956 into the current shape. The state was renamed as Tamil Nadu, meaning \"Tamil Country\", in 1969. Hence, culture, cuisine and architecture have seen multiple influences over the years and have developed diversely.\nAs the most urbanised state of India, Tamil Nadu boasts an economy with gross state domestic product (GSDP) of \u20b923.65 lakh crore (US$300 billion), making it the second-largest economy amongst the 28 states of India. It has the country's 9th-highest GSDP per capita of \u20b9275,583 (US$3,500) and ranks 11th in human development index. Tamil Nadu is also one of the most industrialised states, with the manufacturing sector accounting for nearly one-third of the state's GDP. With its diverse culture and architecture, long coastline, forests and mountains, Tamil Nadu is home to a number of ancient relics, historic buildings, religious sites, beaches, hill stations, forts, waterfalls and four World Heritage Sites with the state's tourism industry, the largest among the Indian states. Forests occupy an area of 22,643 km2 (8,743 sq mi) constituting 17.4% of the geographic area of which protected areas cover an area of 3,305 km2 (1,276 sq mi), around 15% of the recorded forest area of the state and consists of three biosphere reserves, mangrove forests, five National Parks, 18 wildlife sanctuaries and 17 bird sanctuaries.

Artifacts recovered in Adichanallur by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) indicate a continuous history from more than 3,800 years ago. Neolithic celts with the Indus script dated between 1500 and 2000 BCE indicate the use of the Harappan language. Excavations at Keezhadi have revealed a large urban settlement dating to the 6th century BCE, during the time of urbanization in the Indo-Gangetic plain. Further epigraphical inscriptions found at Adichanallur use Tamil Brahmi, a rudimentary script dated to 5th century BCE. Potsherds uncovered from Keeladi indicate a script which is a transition between the Indus Valley script and Tamil Brahmi script used later.\n\n\n=== Sangam period (5th century BCE\u20133rd century CE) ===\n\nThe Sangam period lasted for about eight centuries, from 500 BCE to 300 CE with the main source of history during the period coming from the Sangam literature. Ancient Tamilakam was ruled by a triumvirate of monarchical states, Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas. The Cheras controlled the western part of Tamilkam, the Pandyas controlled the south, and the Cholas had their base in the Kaveri delta. The kings called Vendhar ruled over several tribes of Velala (peasants), headed by the Velir chiefs. The rulers patronized multiple religions including vedic religion, Buddhism and Jainism and sponsored some of the earliest Tamil literature with the oldest surviving work being Tolk\u0101ppiyam, a book of Tamil grammar.The kingdoms had significant diplomatic and trade contacts with other kingdoms to the north and Romans. Much of the commerce from the Romans and Han China were facilitated via seaports including Muziris and Korkai with spices being the most prized goods along with pearls and silk. From 300CE, the Kalabhras much of Tamilkam, who are believed to be of the Vellalar community of warriors who were possibly once the feudatories of the ancient Tamil kingdoms. The Kalabhra era is referred to as the \"dark period\" of Tamil history, and information about it is generally inferred from any mentions in the literature and inscriptions that are dated many centuries after their era ended. The twin Tamil epics Silappatikaram and Manimekalai were written during the era.

Though they existed previously, the period saw the rise of the Pallavas in the sixth century CE under Mahendravarman I, who ruled parts of South India with Kanchipuram as their capital. Pallavas were noted for their patronage of architecture with the origins of massive gopuram, ornate towers at the entrance of temples, traced back to the Pallavas. They built the group of rock-cut monuments in Mahabalipuram and temples in Kanchipuram. Throughout their reign, Pallavas remained in constant conflict with the Cholas and Pandyas. The Pandyas were revived by Kadungon towards the end of the 6th century CE and with the Cholas in obscurity in Uraiyur, the Tamil country was divided between the Pallavas and the Pandyas. The Pallavas were finally defeated by Aditya I in the 9th century CE.\nThe Cholas became the dominant kingdom in the 9th century under Vijayalaya Chola, who established Thanjavur as Chola's new capital with further expansions by subsequent rulers. In the 11th century CE, Rajaraja I expanded the Chola empire with conquests of entire Southern India and parts of present-day Sri Lanka, Maldives and increasing Chola influence across the Indian Ocean. Rajaraja brought in administrative reforms including the reorganisation of Tamil country into individual administrative units. Under his son Rajendra Chola I, the Chola empire reached its zenith and stretched as far as Bengal in the north and across the Indian Ocean. The Cholas built many temples in the Dravidian style with the most notable being the Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, one of the foremost temples of the era built by Raja Raja and Gangaikonda Cholapuram built by Rajendra.The Pandyas again reigned supreme early in the 13th century under Maravarman Sundara I. They ruled from their capital of Madurai and expanded trade links with other maritime empires. During the 13th century, Marco Polo mentioned the Pandyas as the richest empire in existence. Pandyas also built a number of temples including the Meenakshi Amman Temple at Madurai.\n\n\n=== Vijayanagar and Nayak period (14th\u201317th century CE) ===\nIn the 13th and 14th century, there were repeated attacks from Delhi Sultanate. The Vijayanagara kingdom was founded in 1336 CE. The Vijayanagara empire eventually conquered the entire Tamil country by c.\u20091370 and ruled for almost two centuries until its defeat in the Battle of Talikota in 1565 by a confederacy of Deccan sultanates.\nLater, the Nayaks, who were the military governors in the Vijaynagara Empire, took control of the region amongst whom the Nayaks of Madurai and Nayaks of Thanjavur were the most prominent. They introduced the palayakkararar system and re-constructed some of the well-known temples in Tamil Nadu including the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai.\n\n\n=== Later conflicts and European colonization (17th to 20th century CE) ===\nIn the 18th century, the Mughal empire administered the region through the Nawab of the Carnatic with his seat at Arcot, who defeated the Madurai Nayaks.", "start_char_idx": 5940, "end_char_idx": 9165, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c94ad58f-d247-4bc5-b81a-450290f161fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "c94ad58f-d247-4bc5-b81a-450290f161fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Tamil_Nadu.txt", "file_name": "Tamil_Nadu.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 72661, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4ab7599d-1f01-4db9-b369-0fc1abba9da1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Tamil_Nadu.txt", "file_name": "Tamil_Nadu.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 72661, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "23ed18ae6dd171478914cc1fd41e57a69d65bed52d4e31446a883aa56049f813", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6fc87090-1224-40f1-bdb4-c0975fa209d1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Tamil_Nadu.txt", "file_name": "Tamil_Nadu.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 72661, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "09819aa72b1d2f993a16c00bf2f130a108d31bce9ae28e2d55630624793e1c58", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "27b4bbaf-fccd-4788-95b0-192224a915fd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d4c913408391bda34b9720052162648493e9f4b0e3abf1132dc4fc7e3aada958", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Later conflicts and European colonization (17th to 20th century CE) ===\nIn the 18th century, the Mughal empire administered the region through the Nawab of the Carnatic with his seat at Arcot, who defeated the Madurai Nayaks. The Marathas attacked several times and defeated the Nawab after the Siege of Trichinopoly (1751-1752). This led to a short-lived Thanjavur Maratha kingdom.\nEuropeans started to establish trade centers from the 16th century along the eastern coast. The Portuguese arrived in 1522 and built a port named S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 near present-day Mylapore in Madras. In 1609, Dutch established a settlement in Pulicat and the Danish had their establishment in Tharangambadi. On 20 August 1639, Francis Day of the British East India Company met with the Vijayanager emperor Peda Venkata Raya and obtained a grant for land on the Coromandel coast for their trading activities. A year later, the company built Fort St. George, the first major English settlement in India, which became the nucleus of the British Raj in the region. By 1693, French established trading posts at Pondich\u00e9ry. The British and French competed to expand the trade which led to Battle of Wandiwash as part of the Seven Years' War. The British regained control in 1749 through the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle and resisted a French siege attempt in 1759. The Nawabs of the Carnatic surrendered much of its territory to the British East India Company in the north and bestowed tax revenue collection rights in the South, which led to constant conflicts with the Palaiyakkarars known as the Polygar Wars. Puli Thevar was one of the earliest opponents, joined later by Rani Velu Nachiyar of Sivagangai and Kattabomman of Panchalakurichi in the first series of Polygar wars. The Maruthu brothers along with Oomaithurai, the brother of Kattabomman formed a coalition with Dheeran Chinnamalai and Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja, which fought the British in the Second Polygar Wars. In the later 18th century, the Mysore kingdom captured parts of the region and engaged in constant fighting with the British which culminated in the four Anglo-Mysore Wars.\nBy the 18th century, the British had conquered most of the region and established the Madras Presidency with Madras as the capital. After the defeat of Mysore in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War in 1799 and the British victory in the second Polygar war in 1801, the British consolidated most of southern India into what was later known as the Madras Presidency. On 10 July 1806, The Vellore mutiny, which was the first instance of a large-scale mutiny by Indian sepoys against the British East India Company took place in Vellore Fort. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British Raj was formed after the British crown took over the control of governance from the company.Failure of the summer monsoons and administrative shortcomings of the Ryotwari system resulted in two severe famines in the Madras Presidency, the Great Famine of 1876\u201378 and the Indian famine of 1896\u201397 which killed millions and the migration of many Tamils as bonded laborers to other British countries eventually forming the present Tamil diaspora.", "start_char_idx": 8936, "end_char_idx": 12083, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27b4bbaf-fccd-4788-95b0-192224a915fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "27b4bbaf-fccd-4788-95b0-192224a915fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Tamil_Nadu.txt", "file_name": "Tamil_Nadu.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 72661, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4ab7599d-1f01-4db9-b369-0fc1abba9da1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Tamil_Nadu.txt", "file_name": "Tamil_Nadu.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 72661, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "23ed18ae6dd171478914cc1fd41e57a69d65bed52d4e31446a883aa56049f813", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c94ad58f-d247-4bc5-b81a-450290f161fe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Tamil_Nadu.txt", "file_name": "Tamil_Nadu.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 72661, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "982e84deb2270e8ffdbcebb0a4cfe7d4965cf10b2601f6088dde554cd3b26615", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d20832e6-b0ed-42c3-8ded-79766d7d447a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5ab549bd54c1f1abdffa054dc47488c9ab302dc116ec056cf11ef52e08aa943d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Indian Independence movement gathered momentum in the early 20th century with the formation of Indian National Congress, which was based on an idea propagated by the members of the Theosophical Society movement after a Theosophical convention held in Madras in December 1884.

Andhra state was split from the state in 1953 and the state was further re-organized when states were redrawn linguistically in 1956 into the current shape. On 14 January 1969, Madras State was renamed Tamil Nadu, meaning \"Tamil country\". In 1965, agitations against the imposition of Hindi and in support of continuing English as a medium of communication arose which eventually led to English being retained as an official language of India alongside Hindi. After independence, the economy of Tamil Nadu conformed to a socialist framework, with strict governmental control over private sector participation, foreign trade, and foreign direct investment. After experiencing fluctuations in the decades immediately after Indian independence, the economy of Tamil Nadu consistently exceeded national average growth rates from the 1970s, due to reform-oriented economic policies.

It is located on the south-eastern coast of the Indian peninsula, Tamil Nadu is straddled by the Western Ghats and Deccan Plateau in the west, the Eastern Ghats in the north, the Eastern Coastal Plains lining the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait to the south-east, the Laccadive Sea at the southern cape of the peninsula. Politically, Tamil Nadu is bound by the Indian states of Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, and the union territory of Puducherry and shares an international maritime border with the Northern Province of Sri Lanka at Pamban Island. The Palk Strait and the chain of low sandbars and islands known as Rama's Bridge separate the region from Sri Lanka, which lies off the southeastern coast. The southernmost tip of mainland India is at Kanyakumari where the Indian Ocean meets the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.The Western Ghats runs south along the western boundary with the highest peak at Doddabetta (2,636 m (8,648 ft)) in the Nilgiri Hills. The Eastern Ghats run parallel to the Bay of Bengal along the eastern coast and the strip of land between them forms the Coromandel region. They are a discontinuous range of mountains intersected by Kaveri river. Both mountain ranges meet at the Nilgiri mountains which run in a crescent approximately along the borders of Tamil Nadu with northern Kerala and Karnataka, extending to the relatively low-lying hills of the Eastern Ghats on the western portion of the Tamil Nadu\u2013Andhra Pradesh border.The Deccan plateau is the elevated region bound by the mountain ranges and the plateau slopes gently from West to East resulting in major rivers arising in the Western Ghats and flowing east into the Bay of Bengal.Tamil Nadu has a 1,076 km (669 mi) coastline long and is the second longest coastline in the country after Gujarat. There are coral reefs located in the Gulf of Mannar and Lakshadweep islands. Tamil Nadu's coastline was permanently altered by the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004.\n\n\n=== Geology ===\nTamil Nadu falls mostly in a region of low seismic hazard with the exception of the western border areas that lie in a low to moderate hazard zone; as per the 2002 Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) map, Tamil Nadu falls in Zones II and III. The volcanic basalt beds of the Deccan were laid down in the massive Deccan Traps eruption, which occurred towards the end of the Cretaceous period, between 67 and 66 million years ago. Layer after layer was formed by the volcanic activity that lasted many years and when the volcanoes became extinct, they left a region of highlands with typically vast stretches of flat areas on top like a table. The predominant soils of Tamil Nadu are red loam, laterite, black, alluvial and saline. Red soil with a higher iron content, occupies a larger portion of the state and all the inland districts. Black soil is found in western Tamil Nadu and parts of southern coast. Alluvial soil is found in the fertile Kaveri delta region with laterite soil found in pockets and saline soil across the coast where the evaporation is high.", "start_char_idx": 13841, "end_char_idx": 17051, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "278a1323-76ce-40a0-b4c7-b2bff4cc9ed1": {"__data__": {"id_": "278a1323-76ce-40a0-b4c7-b2bff4cc9ed1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Tamil_Nadu.txt", "file_name": "Tamil_Nadu.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 72661, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4ab7599d-1f01-4db9-b369-0fc1abba9da1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Tamil_Nadu.txt", "file_name": "Tamil_Nadu.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 72661, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "23ed18ae6dd171478914cc1fd41e57a69d65bed52d4e31446a883aa56049f813", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d20832e6-b0ed-42c3-8ded-79766d7d447a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Tamil_Nadu.txt", "file_name": "Tamil_Nadu.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 72661, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "e53462e5d024dc8db732bdbf66b0f9f0c3f81ca265c15cb6fc36c28b69dfe732", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b574f539-76ca-4d7d-be68-d1f0f38505ce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f9c9c1301d63943a15fa391ba03c53ce73fbe021b3a4a555b48fde0b2337e9c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Climate ===\nThe region has a tropical climate and depends on monsoons for rainfall. Tamil Nadu is divided into seven agro-climatic zones: northeast, northwest, west, southern, high rainfall, high altitude hilly, and Kaveri delta. A tropical wet and dry climate prevails over most of the inland peninsular region except for a semi-arid rain shadow east of the Western Ghats. Winter and early summer are long dry periods with temperatures averaging above 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F); summer is exceedingly hot with temperatures in low-lying areas exceeding 50 \u00b0C (122 \u00b0F); and the rainy season lasts from June to September, with annual rainfall averaging between 750 and 1,500 mm (30 and 59 in) across the region. Once the dry northeast monsoon begins in September, most precipitation in India falls in Tamil Nadu, leaving other states comparatively dry. A hot semi-arid climate predominates in the land east of the Western Ghats which includes inland south and south central parts of the state and gets between 400 and 750 millimetres (15.7 and 29.5 in) of rainfall annually, with hot summers and dry winters with temperatures around 20\u201324 \u00b0C (68\u201375 \u00b0F). The months between March and May are hot and dry, with mean monthly temperatures hovering around 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F), with 320 millimetres (13 in) precipitation. Without artificial irrigation, this region is not suitable for agriculture.The southwest monsoon from June to September accounts for most of the rainfall in the region. The Arabian Sea branch of the southwest monsoon hits the Western Ghats from Kerala and moves northward along the Konkan coast, with precipitation on the western region of the state. The lofty Western Ghats prevent the winds from reaching the Deccan Plateau; hence, the leeward region (the region deprived of winds) receives very little rainfall. The Bay of Bengal branch of the southwest monsoon heads toward northeast India, picking up moisture from the Bay of Bengal and the Coramandel coast does not receive much rainfall from the southwest monsoon, due to the shape of the land. Northern Tamil Nadu receives most of its rains from the northeast monsoon. The northeast monsoon takes place from November to early March, when the surface high-pressure system is strongest. The North Indian Ocean tropical cyclones occur throughout the year in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, bringing devastating winds and heavy rainfall. The annual rainfall of the state is about 945 mm (37.2 in) of which 48 per cent is through the northeast monsoon, and 52 per cent through the southwest monsoon. The state has only 3% of the water resources nationally and is entirely dependent on rains for recharging its water resources, monsoon failures lead to acute water scarcity and severe drought.\n\n\n=== Flora and fauna ===\n\nForests occupy an area of 22,643 km2 (8,743 sq mi) constituting 17.4% of the geographic area. There is a wide diversity of plants and animals in Tamil Nadu, resulting from its varied climates and geography. Deciduous forests are found along the Western Ghats while tropical dry forests and scrub lands are common in the interior.

Politics in Tamil Nadu was dominated by national parties till 1960s and regional parties have ruled ever since. The Justice Party and Swaraj Party were the two major parties in the erstwhile Madras Presidency. During the 1920s and 1930s, the Self-Respect Movement, spearheaded by Theagaroya Chetty and E. V. Ramaswamy (commonly known as Periyar), emerged in the Madras Presidency and led to the formation of Justice party. The Justice Party eventually lost the 1937 elections to the Indian National Congress and Chakravarti Rajagopalachari became the chief minister of the Madras Presidency. In 1944, Periyar transformed the Justice party into a social organisation, renaming the party Dravidar Kazhagam, and withdrew from electoral politics. After independence, Indian National Congress dominated the political scene in Tamil Nadu in the 1950s and 1960s under the leadership of K. Kamaraj, who led the party after the death of Jawaharlal Nehru and ensured the selection of Prime Ministers Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi. C. N. Annadurai, a follower of Periyar, formed the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in 1949.The Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu led to the rise of Dravidian parties that formed Tamil Nadu's first government, in 1967. In 1972, a split in the DMK resulted in the formation of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) led by M. G. Ramachandran. Dravidian parties continue to dominate Tamil Nadu electoral politics with the national parties usually aligning as junior partners to the major Dravidian parties, AIADMK and DMK. M. Karunanidhi became the leader of the DMK after Annadurai and J. Jayalalithaa succeeded as the leader of AIADMK after M. G. Ramachandran.

Coconut and spices are used extensively in Tamil cuisine. The region has a rich cuisine involving both traditional non-vegetarian and vegetarian dishes made of rice, legumes, and lentils with its distinct aroma and flavour achieved by the blending of flavourings and spices. The traditional way of eating a meal involves being seated on the floor, having the food served on a banana leaf, and using clean fingers of the right hand to take the food into the mouth. After the meal, the fingers are washed; the easily degradable banana leaf is discarded or becomes fodder for cattle. Eating on banana leaves is a custom thousands of years old, imparts a unique flavor to the food, and is considered healthy.

This includes the oldest grammatical treatise, Tholkappiyam, and the epics Silappatikaram and Manimekalai. The earliest epigraphic records found on rock edicts and hero stones date from around the 3rd century BCE. The available literature from the Sangam period was categorised and compiled into two categories based roughly on chronology: Pathinenmaelkanakku consisting of E\u1e6d\u1e6duttokai and the Pattupattu and Pathinenkilkanakku. The existent Tamil grammar is largely based on the 13th-century grammar book Na\u1e49\u1e49\u016bl based on the Tolk\u0101ppiyam and the Tamil grammar consists of five parts, namely e\u1e3buttu, sol, poru\u1e37, y\u0101ppu, a\u1e47i. Tirukkural, a book on ethics, by Thiruvalluvar is amongst the most popular works of Tamil literature.In the beginning of the middle age, Vaishnava and Saiva literature became prominent following the Bhakti movement in sixth century CE with hymns composed by Alwars and Nayanmars.

After a lull in the intermediate years due to various invasions and instability, the Tamil literature recovered in the 14th century CE, with the notable work being Tiruppugal by Arunagirinathar.

'great realms') or oligarchic republics that existed in ancient India, seven fell entirely within the present-day boundaries of the state. The kingdom of Kosala, in the Mahajanapada era, was also located within the regional boundaries of modern-day Uttar Pradesh. According to Hinduism, the divine King Rama of the Ramayana epic reigned in Ayodhya, the capital of Kosala. Krishna, another divine king of Hindu legend, who plays a key role in the Mahabharata epic and is revered as the eighth reincarnation (Avatar) of the Hindu god Vishnu, is said to have been born in the city of Mathura.

It included parts of central India, north of the Narmada River and it encompassed the entire Indo-Gangetic Plain. Many communities in various parts of India claim descent from the migrants of Kannauj. Soon after Harshavardhana's death, his empire disintegrated into many kingdoms, which were invaded and ruled by the Gurjara-Pratihara empire, which challenged Bengal's Pala Empire for control of the region.

Ajmer and Jaipur kingdoms were also included in this northern territory, which was named the \"North-Western Provinces\" (of Agra). Although UP later became the fifth-largest state of India, NWPA was one of the smallest states of the British Indian empire. Its capital shifted twice between Agra and Allahabad.Due to dissatisfaction with British rule, a serious rebellion erupted in various parts of North India, which became known as the Indian Rebellion of 1857; Bengal regiment's sepoy stationed at Meerut cantonment, Mangal Pandey, is widely considered as its starting point. After the revolt failed, the British divided the most rebellious regions by reorganising their administrative boundaries, splitting the Delhi region from 'NWFP of Agra' and merging it with Punjab Province, while the Ajmer\u2013Marwar region was merged with Rajputana and Oudh was incorporated into the state. The new state was called the North Western Provinces of Agra and Oudh, which in 1902 was renamed as the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. It was commonly referred to as the United Provinces or its acronym UP.In 1920, the capital of the province was shifted from Allahabad to Lucknow. The high court continued to be at Allahabad, but a bench was established at Lucknow. Allahabad continues to be an important administrative base of today's Uttar Pradesh and has several administrative headquarters. Uttar Pradesh continued to be central to Indian politics and was especially important in modern Indian history as a hotbed of the Indian independence movement. The state hosted modern educational institutions such as the Aligarh Muslim University, Banaras Hindu University and Darul Uloom Deoband.

The state has provided nine of India's prime ministers which is more than any other state and is the source of the largest number of seats in the Lok Sabha. Despite its political influence since ancient times, its poor record in economic development and administration, poor governance, organised crime and corruption have kept it among India's backward states. The state has been affected by repeated episodes of caste and communal violence. In December 1992 the disputed Babri Mosque located in Ayodhya was demolished by Hindu activists, leading to widespread violence across India. In 2000, northern districts of the state were separated to form the state of Uttarakhand.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nUttar Pradesh, with a total area of 240,928 square kilometres (93,023 sq mi), is India's fourth-largest state in terms of land area and is roughly of same size as United Kingdom. It is situated on the northern spout of India and shares an international boundary with Nepal. The Himalayas border the state on the north, but the plains that cover most of the state are distinctly different from those high mountains. The larger Gangetic Plain region is in the north; it includes the Ganges-Yamuna Doab, the Ghaghra plains, the Ganges plains and the Terai. The smaller Vindhya Range and plateau region are in the south. It is characterised by hard rock strata and a varied topography of hills, plains, valleys and plateaus. The Bhabhar tract gives place to the terai area which is covered with tall elephant grass and thick forests interspersed with marshes and swamps. The sluggish rivers of the bhabhar deepen in this area, their course running through a tangled mass of thick undergrowth. The terai runs parallel to the bhabhar in a thin strip. The entire alluvial plain is divided into three sub-regions. The first in the eastern tract consisting of 14 districts which are subject to periodical floods and droughts and have been classified as scarcity areas. These districts have the highest density of population which gives the lowest per capita land. The other two regions, the central and the western, are comparatively better with a well-developed irrigation system. They suffer from waterlogging and large-scale user tracts. In addition, the area is fairly arid. The state has more than 32 large and small rivers; of them, the Ganga, Yamuna, Saraswati, Sarayu, Betwa, and Ghaghara are larger and of religious importance in Hinduism.Cultivation is intensive in the state. Uttar Pradesh falls under three agro-climatic zones viz. Middle Gangetic Plains region (Zone\u2013IV), Upper Gangetic Plains region (Zone\u2013V) and Central Plateau and Hills region (Zone\u2013VIII). The valley areas have fertile and rich soil. There is intensive cultivation on terraced hill slopes, but irrigation facilities are deficient.

Uttar Pradesh won its first Ranji Trophy tournament in February 2006, beating Bengal in the final. Shaheed Vijay Singh Pathik Sports Complex is another newly built international cricket stadium with a capacity of around 20,000 spectators.The Buddh International Circuit hosted India's inaugural F1 Grand Prix race on 30 October 2011. Races were only held three times before being cancelled due to falling attendance and lack of government support. The government of Uttar Pradesh considered Formula One to be entertainment and not a sport, and thus imposed taxes on the event and participants.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nUttar Pradesh has a prolonged tradition of education, although historically it was primarily confined to the elite class and religious schools. Sanskrit-based learning formed the major part of education from the Vedic to the Gupta periods. As cultures travelled through the region they brought their bodies of knowledge with them, adding Pali, Persian and Arabic scholarship to the community. These formed the core of Hindu-Buddhist-Muslim education until the rise of British colonialism. The present schools-to-university system of education owes its inception and development in the state (as in the rest of the country) to foreign Christian missionaries and the British colonial administration. Schools in the state are either managed by the government or by private trusts. Hindi is used as a medium of instruction in most of the schools except those affiliated to the CBSE or the council for ICSE boards. Under the 10+2+3 plan, after completing secondary school, students typically enroll for two years in a junior college, also known as pre-university, or in schools with a higher secondary facility affiliated with the Uttar Pradesh Board of High School and Intermediate Education or a central board. Students choose from one of three streams, namely liberal arts, commerce, or science. Upon completing the required coursework, students may enrol in general or professional degree programs. Some Uttar Pradesh schools, for example Delhi Public School (Noida), La Martini\u00e8re Girls' College (Lucknow), and Step by Step School (Noida) have been ranked among the best schools in the country.\nUttar Pradesh has more than 45 universities, including five central universities, twenty eight state universities, eight deemed universities, two IITs in Varanasi and Kanpur, AIIMS Gorakhpur and AIIMS Rae Bareli, an IIM in LucknowThe Integral University, a state level institution, was established by the Uttar Pradesh Government to provide education in different technical, applied science, and other disciplines. The Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies was founded as an autonomous organisation by the national ministry of culture. Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University is the only university established exclusively for the disabled in the world. A large number of Indian scholars are educated at different universities in Uttar Pradesh. Notable scholars who were born, worked or studied in the geographic area of the state include Harivansh Rai Bachchan, Motilal Nehru, Harish Chandra and Indira Gandhi.", "start_char_idx": 40749, "end_char_idx": 44541, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dad8888d-5b64-486a-bacd-554a0cc8a822": {"__data__": {"id_": "dad8888d-5b64-486a-bacd-554a0cc8a822", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Uttar_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Uttar_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 52910, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f9f0e9d-490b-4c7e-9791-15e34f01ff01", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Uttar_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Uttar_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 52910, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "d24514c3722b8648c67cb509a8a7845b3685c907261984de67746d51b799e625", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2a1f54ed-fd3a-40b5-b122-87d62da36680", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Uttar_Pradesh.txt", "file_name": "Uttar_Pradesh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 52910, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "974f5fb100192557c2b0beb9eef850bc9d7c73ff29e6f51f7f0352e5953d265d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "503280ba-4be6-498d-aecf-42480bbab913", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe883bd890fda40080ae3f7455d9a34a5cf3d03efc03ec439b6e6b6a7cfcb959", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Tourism ==\n\nUttar Pradesh ranks first in domestic tourist arrivals among all states of India. Some 44,000 foreign tourists arrived in the state in 2021, and almost 110 million domestic tourists.

The state is home to three World Heritage Sites: the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, and the nearby Fatehpur Sikri.Religious tourism plays a significant role in the state's economy. Varanasi is a major religious hub and one of the seven sacred cities (Sapta Puri) in Hinduism and Jainism. Vrindavan is considered to be a holy place for Vaishnavism.Owing to the belief as to the birthplace of Rama, Ayodhya (Awadh) has been regarded as one of the seven most important pilgrimage sites. Millions gather at Prayagraj to take part in the Magh Mela festival on the banks of the Ganges. This festival is organised on a larger scale every 12th year and is called the Kumbh Mela, where over 10 million Hindu pilgrims congregate in one of the largest gatherings of people in the world.Buddhist attractions in Uttar Pradesh include stupas and monasteries. The historically important towns of Sarnath where Gautama Buddha gave his first sermon after his enlightenment and died at Kushinagar; both of which are important pilgrimage sites for Buddhists. Also at Sarnath are the Pillars of Ashoka and the Lion Capital of Ashoka, both important archaeological artefacts with national significance.

Public healthcare in Uttar Pradesh is provided through a grid of primary health centers, community health centers, district hospitals, and medical colleges. Although an extensive network of public and private sector healthcare providers has been built, the available health infrastructure is inadequate to meet the demand for health services in the state. In 15 years to 2012\u201313, the population increased by more than 25 per cent. The public health centres, which are the frontline of the government's health care system, decreased by 8 per cent. Smaller sub-centres, the first point of public contact, increased by no more than 2 per cent over the 25 years to 2015, a period when the population grew by more than 51 per cent. The state is also facing challenges such as a shortage of healthcare professionals, increasing cost of healthcare, a lack of essential medicines and equipment, the mushrooming of private healthcare and a lack of planning. As of 2017, the number of government hospital in rural and urban areas of Uttar Pradesh stood at 4,442 with 39,104 beds and 193 with 37,156 beds respectively.A newborn in Uttar Pradesh is expected to live four years fewer than in the neighbouring state of Bihar, five years fewer than in Haryana and seven years fewer than in Himachal Pradesh. The state contributed to the largest share of almost all communicable and noncommunicable disease deaths, including 48 per cent of all typhoid deaths (2014); 17 per cent of cancer deaths and 18 per cent of tuberculosis deaths (2015). Its maternal mortality ratio is higher than the national average at 258 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births (2017), with 62 per cent of pregnant women unable to access minimum ante-natal care. Around 42 per cent of pregnant women, more than 1.5 million, deliver babies at home. About two-thirds (61 per cent) of childbirths at home in the state are unsafe. It has the highest child mortality indicators, from the neonatal mortality rate to the under-five mortality rate of 64 children who die per 1,000 live births before five years of age, 35 die within a month of birth, and 50 do not complete a year of life.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Language and literature ===\n\nSeveral texts and hymns of the Vedic literature were composed in Uttar Pradesh.

The festival of Guru Purnima is dedicated to Sage Vyasa, and also known as Vyasa Purnima as it is the day which is believed to be his birthday and also the day he divided the Vedas.Hindi became the language of state administration with the Uttar Pradesh Official Language Act of 1951. A 1989 amendment to the act added Urdu, as an additional language of the state. Linguistically, the state spreads across the Central, East-Central, and Eastern zones of the Indo Aryan languages.

The state is divided into two divisions, Garhwal and Kumaon, with a total of 13 districts. The winter capital and largest city of the state is Dehradun, which is also a railhead. On 5 March 2020, Bhararisain, a town in the Gairsain Tehsil of the Chamoli district, was declared as  the summer capital of Uttarakhand. The High Court of the state is located in Nainital, but is to be moved to Haldwani in future.Uttarakhand borders the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north; the Sudurpashchim Province of Nepal to the east; the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh to the south and Himachal Pradesh to the west and north-west. It is often referred to as the \"Devbhumi\" (lit.\u2009'Land of the Gods') due to its religious significance and numerous Hindu temples and pilgrimage centres found throughout the state. Uttarakhand is known for the natural environment of the Himalayas, the Bhabar and the Terai regions.\nIn 1816, most of modern Uttarakhand was ceded to the British as part of the Treaty of Sugauli. Although the erstwhile hill kingdoms of Garhwal and Kumaon were traditional rivals, the proximity of different neighbouring ethnic groups and the inseparable and complementary nature of their geography, economy, culture, language, and traditions created strong bonds between the two regions, which further strengthened during the Uttarakhand movement for statehood in the 1990s.\nThe natives of the state are generally called Uttarakhandi, or more specifically either Garhwali or Kumaoni depending on their region of origin.

The name finds mention in early Hindu scriptures as the combined region of \"Kedarkhand\" (present day Garhwal) and \"Manaskhand\" (present day Kumaon). Uttarakhand was also the ancient Puranic term for the central stretch of the Indian Himalayas.However, the region was given the name Uttaranchal by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led union government and Uttarakhand state government when they started a new round of state reorganisation in 1998. Chosen as per BJP claims for its allegedly less-separatist connotations, since the proposed state name Uttarakhand had been used exclusively in all major statehood protests. The name change generated widespread controversy among many activists and citizens who saw it as a political act meant to hijack credit from the activist party Uttarakhand Kranti Dal. The name Uttarakhand remained popular in the region, while Uttaranchal was promulgated only through official usage.In August 2006, Union Council of Ministers assented to the demands of the Uttaranchal Legislative Assembly and leading members of the Uttarakhand statehood movement to rename Uttaranchal state as Uttarakhand. Legislation to that effect was passed by the Uttaranchal Legislative Assembly in October 2006, and the Union Council of Ministers brought in the bill in the winter session of Parliament. The bill was passed by the Parliament and signed into law by then President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam in December 2006, and since 1 January 2007 the state has been known as Uttarakhand.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nArchaeological evidence supports the existence of humans in the region since prehistoric times. Though initially, it was believed that due to harsh climate and mountainous terrain, this was a barren and uninhabited land. But after various excavations and the study of ancient literature, it is now established that the history of Uttarakhand goes back to Stone Age. Evidences of Stone Age settlements have been found in various parts of Kumaon and Garhwal, particularly notable are the rock shelters at Lakhudyar, Almora.\nThe region formed a part of the Uttarakuru Kingdom during the Vedic age of Ancient India. Among the first major dynasties of Kumaon were the Kunindas in the second century BCE who practised an early form of Shaivism. Ashokan edicts at Kalsi show the early presence of Buddhism in this region.\nAncient rock paintings, rock shelters, paleolithic age stone tools (hundreds of thousands of years old), and megaliths provide evidence that the mountains of the region have been inhabited since prehistoric times. There are also archaeological remains that show the existence of early Vedic (c.\u20091500 BCE) practices in the area. The Pauravas, Khasas, Kiratas, Nandas, Mauryas, Kushanas, Kunindas, Guptas, Karkotas, Palas, Gurjara-Pratiharas, Katyuris, Raikas, Chands, Parmars or Panwars, Mallas, Shahs and the British have ruled Uttarakhand in turns.Among the first major dynasties of Garhwal and Kumaon were the Kunindas in the second century BCE who practised an early form of Shaivism and traded salt with Western Tibet.", "start_char_idx": 1840, "end_char_idx": 5078, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e5c1d92-3399-42e9-b62f-acd99da3a36c": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e5c1d92-3399-42e9-b62f-acd99da3a36c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Uttarakhand.txt", "file_name": "Uttarakhand.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47540, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "482c91ca-d0ef-4b26-9fe2-573a48e01c62", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Uttarakhand.txt", "file_name": "Uttarakhand.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47540, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "3562a9a98ba1239cba428be4b3ae6f13673b37eb078dbbfcdd5242f69f396734", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9ee14c34-4c9d-4263-bd3c-99b20c0ec7c9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Uttarakhand.txt", "file_name": "Uttarakhand.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47540, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "d2da31b84251b3cdc5083eb9f32d2762f1e5fcab255e0aa18dd11e19e937b54b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f44c0c63-81a6-4ad0-8936-ca67ceadcec7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8d1c337cc95d280613354d2474484e2bf991ad8a8d6420071104c5271539e3f0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It is evident from the Ashokan edict at Kalsi in Western Garhwal that Buddhism made inroads in this region. Shamanic Hindu practices deviating from Hindu orthodoxy also persisted here. However, Garhwal and Kumaon were restored to nominal Vedic Hindu rule due to the travels of Shankaracharya and the arrival of migrants from the plains.\n\nBetween the 4th and 14th centuries, the Katyuri dynasty dominated lands of varying extents from the Katyur valley (modern-day Baijnath) in Kumaon. The historically significant temples at Jageshwar are believed to have been built by the Katyuris and later remodeled by the Chands. Other peoples of the Tibeto-Burman group known as Kirata are thought to have settled in the northern highlands as well as in pockets throughout the region, and are believed to be ancestors of the modern day Bhotiya, Raji, Jad, and Banrawat people.During the medieval period, the region was consolidated under the Katyuri rulers of Kumaon also known as 'Kurmanchal Kingdom'. After the fall of Katyuris, the region was divided into the Kumaon Kingdom and the Garhwal Kingdom.\n\nBy the medieval period, the region was consolidated under the Garhwal Kingdom in the west and the Kumaon Kingdom in the east. During this period, learning and new forms of painting (the Pahari school of art) developed. Modern-day Garhwal was likewise unified under the rule of Parmars who, along with many Brahmins and Rajputs, also arrived from the plains. In 1791, the expanding Gorkha Empire of Nepal overran Almora, the seat of the Kumaon Kingdom. It was annexed to the Kingdom of Nepal by Amar Singh Thapa. In 1803, the Garhwal Kingdom also fell to the Gurkhas. After the Anglo-Nepalese War, this region was ceded to the British as part of the Treaty of Sugauli and the erstwhile Kumaon Kingdom along with the eastern region of Garhwal Kingdom was merged with the Ceded and Conquered Provinces. \nIn 1816, the Garhwal Kingdom was re-established from a smaller region in Tehri as a princely state. In the southern part of Uttarakhand in Haridwar district (earlier part of Saharanpur till 1988), the dominance and kingship (rajya) was exercises by Gujar chiefs, the area was under control of Parmar (Panwar or Khubars) Gujars in eastern Saharanpur including Haridwar in kingship of Raja Sabha Chandra of Jabarhera (Jhabrera). Gujars of the Khubar (Panwar) gotra held more than 500 villages there in upper Doab, and that situation was confirmed in 1759 in a grant by a Rohilla governor of 505 villages and 31 hamlets to one Manohar Singh Gujar (written in some records as Raja Nahar Singh son of Sabha Chandra). In 1792 Ram Dayal and his son Sawai Singh were ruling the area but due to some family reasons Ramdayal left Jhabrera and went to Landhaura village, now some villages were under the control of Raja Ramdayal Singh at Landhaura, and some under his son Sawai Singh at Jhabrera.", "start_char_idx": 5079, "end_char_idx": 7958, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f44c0c63-81a6-4ad0-8936-ca67ceadcec7": {"__data__": {"id_": "f44c0c63-81a6-4ad0-8936-ca67ceadcec7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Uttarakhand.txt", "file_name": "Uttarakhand.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47540, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "482c91ca-d0ef-4b26-9fe2-573a48e01c62", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Uttarakhand.txt", "file_name": "Uttarakhand.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47540, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "3562a9a98ba1239cba428be4b3ae6f13673b37eb078dbbfcdd5242f69f396734", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2e5c1d92-3399-42e9-b62f-acd99da3a36c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Uttarakhand.txt", "file_name": "Uttarakhand.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47540, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "08e60b796ce16cf184f21b6250c64f67e604772ab77356e257b309540f3e87a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9e7b6f7f-394d-45b0-90ce-01a3dcd2038c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "430d5ab239a62b0f03b14ef51a312653497a7a0388947851b518ea5e5260df92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In 1792 Ram Dayal and his son Sawai Singh were ruling the area but due to some family reasons Ramdayal left Jhabrera and went to Landhaura village, now some villages were under the control of Raja Ramdayal Singh at Landhaura, and some under his son Sawai Singh at Jhabrera. Hence, there were two branches of Jabarhera estate (riyasat) main branch at Jabarhera and the second one at Landhaura, both father and son were ruling simultaneously without any conflicts till the death of Raja Sawai Singh of Jabarhera in 1803. After the death of Sawai Singh total control of powers transferred to Ram Dayal Singh at Landhaura, but some villages were given to descendants of Sawai Singh and her widow to collect revenue. \nBy 1803 the Landhaura villages numbered 794 under Raja Ram Dayal Singh. Raja Ram Dayal Singh died on 29 March 1813. These holdings, at least those in the original grant made by the Rohilla governor, were initially recognised by the British in land settlements concluded with Ram Dayal and his heirs. As the years passed, more and more settlements appear to have been made with the village communities, however, and by 1850 little remained of the once vast estate of the Landhaura Kh\u00fcbars.\nAfter India attained independence from the British, the Garhwal Kingdom was merged into the state of Uttar Pradesh, where Uttarakhand composed the Garhwal and Kumaon Divisions. Until 1998, Uttarakhand was the name most commonly used to refer to the region, as various political groups, including the Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (Uttarakhand Revolutionary Party), began agitating for separate statehood under its banner. Although the erstwhile hill kingdoms of Garhwal and Kumaon were traditional rivals the inseparable and complementary nature of their geography, economy, culture, language, and traditions created strong bonds between the two regions. These bonds formed the basis of the new political identity of Uttarakhand, which gained significant momentum in 1994, when demand for separate statehood achieved almost unanimous acceptance among both the local populace and national political parties.The most notable incident during this period was the Rampur Tiraha firing case on the night of 1 October 1994, which led to a public uproar. On 24 September 1998, the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly and Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council passed the Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Bill, which began the process of forming a new state. Two years later the Parliament of India passed the Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2000 and thus, on 9 November 2000, Uttarakhand became the 27th state of the Republic of India.\nUttarakhand is also well known for the mass agitation of the 1970s that led to the formation of the Chipko environmental movement and other social movements. Though primarily a livelihood movement rather than a forest conservation movement, it went on to become a rallying point for many future environmentalists, environmental protests, and movements the world over and created a precedent for non-violent protest. It stirred up the existing civil society in India, which began to address the issues of tribal and marginalised people. So much so that, a quarter of a century later, India Today mentioned the people behind the \"forest satyagraha\" of the Chipko movement as among \"100 people who shaped India\". One of Chipko's most salient features was the mass participation of female villagers. It was largely female activists that played pivotal role in the movement.", "start_char_idx": 7685, "end_char_idx": 11169, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e7b6f7f-394d-45b0-90ce-01a3dcd2038c": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e7b6f7f-394d-45b0-90ce-01a3dcd2038c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Uttarakhand.txt", "file_name": "Uttarakhand.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47540, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "482c91ca-d0ef-4b26-9fe2-573a48e01c62", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Uttarakhand.txt", "file_name": "Uttarakhand.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47540, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "3562a9a98ba1239cba428be4b3ae6f13673b37eb078dbbfcdd5242f69f396734", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f44c0c63-81a6-4ad0-8936-ca67ceadcec7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Uttarakhand.txt", "file_name": "Uttarakhand.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47540, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "cb281bbcc2ef4c424b86ae956343351b1e8e68937d3cdb467539d4555d6abf8f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9f5238a7-079c-482e-bc75-ef68781b8245", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1df9bb4e64d6841685600d93de983fa1fb75911a10248a3112b9ff0a3c1357b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "So much so that, a quarter of a century later, India Today mentioned the people behind the \"forest satyagraha\" of the Chipko movement as among \"100 people who shaped India\".

Gaura Devi was the leading activist who started this movement, other participants were Chandi Prasad Bhatt, Sunderlal Bahuguna, and Ghanshyam Raturi, the popular Chipko poet.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nUttarakhand has a total area of 53,566 km2 (20,682 sq mi), of which 86% is mountainous and 65% is covered by forest. Most of the northern part of the state is covered by high Himalayan peaks and glaciers. In the first half of the nineteenth century, the expanding development of Indian roads, railways, and other physical infrastructure was giving rise to concerns over indiscriminate logging, particularly in the Himalaya. Two of the most important rivers in Hinduism originate in the glaciers of Uttarakhand, the Ganges at Gangotri and the Yamuna at Yamunotri. They are fed by myriad lakes, glacial melts, and streams. These two along with Badrinath and Kedarnath form the Chota Char Dham, a holy pilgrimage for the Hindus.The state hosts the Bengal tiger in Jim Corbett National Park, the oldest national park of the Indian subcontinent. The Nanda Devi and Valley of Flowers National Parks, a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the upper expanses of Bhyundar Ganga near Joshimath in Gharwal region, is known for the variety and rarity of its flowers and plants. One who raised this was Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, who visited the region. As a consequence, Lord Dalhousie issued the Indian Forest Charter in 1855, reversing the previous laissez-faire policy. The following Indian Forest Act of 1878 put Indian forestry on a solid scientific basis. A direct consequence was the founding of the Imperial Forest School at Dehradun by Dietrich Brandis in 1878. Renamed the 'Imperial Forest Research Institute' in 1906, it is now known as the Forest Research Institute.The model \"Forest Circles\" around Dehradun, used for training, demonstration and scientific measurements, had a lasting positive influence on the forests and ecology of the region. The Himalayan ecosystem provides habitat for many animals (including bharal, snow leopards, leopards and tigers), plants, and rare herbs.\nUttarakhand lies on the southern slope of the Himalaya range, and the climate and vegetation vary greatly with elevation, from glaciers at the highest elevations to subtropical forests at the lower elevations. The highest elevations are covered by ice and bare rock. Below them, between 3,000 and 5,000 metres (9,800 and 16,400 ft) are the western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows. The temperate western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests grow just below the tree line. At 3,000 to 2,600 metres (9,800 to 8,500 ft) elevation they transition to the temperate western Himalayan broadleaf forests, which lie in a belt from 2,600 to 1,500 metres (8,500 to 4,900 ft) elevation.

The flooding was referred to in the Indian media as a \"Himalayan Tsunami\".On 7 February 2021, floods emerged from the Nanda Devi mountain glaciers, devastating locations along the Rishi Ganga, Dhauli Ganga and Alaknanda Rivers, resulting in many people reported missing or killed, yet to be numbered. The damages include Rini village, several river dams and the Tapovan Vishnugad Hydropower Plant.\n\n\n=== Flora and fauna ===\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nUttarakhand has a diversity of flora and fauna. It has a recorded forest area of 34,666 km2 (13,385 sq mi), which constitutes 65% of the total area of the state. Uttarakhand is home to rare species of plants and animals, many of which are protected by sanctuaries and reserves. National parks in Uttarakhand include the Jim Corbett National Park (the oldest national park of India) in Nainital and Pauri Garhwal District, and Valley of Flowers National Park & Nanda Devi National Park in Chamoli District, which together are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A number of plant species in the valley are internationally threatened, including several that have not been recorded from elsewhere in Uttarakhand. Rajaji National Park in Haridwar, Dehradun and Pauri Garhwal District and Govind Pashu Vihar National Park & Gangotri National Park in Uttarkashi District are some other protected areas in the state.Leopards are found in areas that are abundant in hills but may also venture into the lowland jungles. Smaller felines include the jungle cat, fishing cat, and leopard cat. Other mammals include four kinds of deer (barking, sambar, hog and chital), sloth, Brown and Himalayan black bears, Indian grey mongooses, otters, yellow-throated martens, bharal, Indian pangolins, and langur and rhesus monkeys. In the summer, elephants can be seen in herds of several hundred. Marsh crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris), gharials (Gavialis gangeticus) and other reptiles are also found in the region. Local crocodiles were saved from extinction by captive breeding programs and subsequently re-released into the Ramganga river. Several freshwater terrapins and turtles like the Indian sawback turtle (Kachuga tecta), brahminy river turtle (Hardella thurjii), and Ganges softshell turtle (Trionyx gangeticus) are found in the rivers. Butterflies and birds of the region include red helen (Papilio helenus), the great eggfly (Hypolimnos bolina), common tiger (Danaus genutia), pale wanderer (Pareronia avatar), jungle babbler, tawny-bellied babbler, great slaty woodpecker, red-breasted parakeet, orange-breasted green pigeon and chestnut-winged cuckoo.", "start_char_idx": 13970, "end_char_idx": 17098, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a98fa530-2bf1-442a-8886-a35a0005635f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a98fa530-2bf1-442a-8886-a35a0005635f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Uttarakhand.txt", "file_name": "Uttarakhand.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47540, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "482c91ca-d0ef-4b26-9fe2-573a48e01c62", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Uttarakhand.txt", "file_name": "Uttarakhand.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47540, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "3562a9a98ba1239cba428be4b3ae6f13673b37eb078dbbfcdd5242f69f396734", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9f5238a7-079c-482e-bc75-ef68781b8245", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/Uttarakhand.txt", "file_name": "Uttarakhand.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47540, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "82afc294a5b09682eb1bc57a6f52628238fed7539665fafe5ec684c82eb97d48", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ed612dec-8521-4e5b-8a9e-25ce77db4406", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "73889a48afaa18b74e3cc2bdaff82591884b6e87c52610b8acf82505f1000f4b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In 2011, a rare migratory bird, the bean goose, was also seen in the Jim Corbett National Park.

The languages have been part of various scattered conservation efforts due to their active decline beginning in the later quarter of the 20th century. The decline is hypothesized to be the result of heavy state-sponsered promotion of Hindi as the official language.All the languages enumerated so far belong to the Indo-Aryan family.

On 22 April 2016 the Supreme Court of India stayed the order of High Court till 27 April 2016, thereby once again reviving the President's rule. In later developments regarding this matter, the Supreme Court ordered a floor test to be held on 10 May with the rebels being barred from voting.

WB) is a state in the eastern portion of India. It is situated along the Bay of Bengal, along with a population of over 91 million inhabitants within an area of 88,752 km2 (34,267 sq mi) as of 2011. The population estimate as of 2023 is 102,552,787. West Bengal is the fourth-most populous and thirteenth-largest state by area in India, as well as the eighth-most populous country subdivision of the world. As a part of the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent, it borders Bangladesh in the east, and Nepal and Bhutan in the north. It also borders the Indian states of Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar, Sikkim and Assam. The state capital is Kolkata, the third-largest metropolis, and seventh largest city by population in India. West Bengal includes the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region, the Ganges delta, the Rarh region, the coastal Sundarbans and the Bay of Bengal. The state's main ethnic group are the Bengalis, with the Bengali Hindus forming the demographic majority.\nThe area's early history featured a succession of Indian empires, internal squabbling, and a tussle between Hinduism and Buddhism for dominance. Ancient Bengal was the site of several major Janapadas, while the earliest cities date back to the Vedic period. The region was part of several ancient pan\u2212Indian empires, including the Vangas, Mauryans, and the Guptas. The citadel of Gau\u1e0da served as the capital of the Gau\u1e0da Kingdom, the Pala Empire, and the Sena Empire. Islam was introduced through trade with the Abbasid Caliphate, but following the Ghurid conquests led by Bakhtiyar Khalji and the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate, the Muslim faith spread across the entire Bengal region. During the Bengal Sultanate, the territory was a major trading nation in the world, and was often referred by the Europeans as the \"richest country to trade with\". It was absorbed into the Mughal Empire in 1576. Simultaneously, some parts of the region were ruled by several Hindu states, and Baro-Bhuyan landlords, and part of it was briefly overrun by the Suri Empire. Following the death of Emperor Aurangzeb in the early 1700s, the proto-industrialised Mughal Bengal became a semi-independent state under the Nawabs of Bengal, and showed signs of the first Industrial revolution. The region was later annexed into the Bengal Presidency by the British East India Company after the Battle of Buxar in 1764. From 1772 to 1911, Calcutta was the capital of all of East India Company's territories and then the capital of the entirety of India after the establishment of the Viceroyalty.

The state was also flooded with Hindu refugees from East Bengal (present-day Bangladesh) in the decades following the 1947 partition of India, transforming its landscape and shaping its politics. The early and prolonged exposure to British administration resulted in an expansion of Western education, culminating in developments in science, institutional education, and social reforms in the region, including what became known as the Bengali Renaissance. Several regional and pan\u2212Indian empires throughout Bengal's history have shaped its culture, cuisine, and architecture.\nPost-Indian independence, as a welfare state, West Bengal's economy is based on agricultural production and small and medium-sized enterprises.

One theory suggests the word derives from \"Bang\", the name of a Dravidian tribe that settled the region around 1000 BCE. The Bengali word Bongo might have been derived from the ancient kingdom of Vanga (or Banga). Although some early Sanskrit literature mentions the name Vanga, the region's early history is obscure.In 1947, at the end of British rule over the Indian subcontinent the Bengal Legislative Council and the Bengal Legislative Assembly voted on the Partition of Bengal along religious lines into two separate entities: West Bengal, which continued as an Indian state and East Bengal, a province of Pakistan, which came to be known be as East Pakistan and later became the independent Bangladesh.In 2011 the Government of West Bengal proposed a change in the official name of the state to Paschim Banga (Bengali: \u09aa\u09b6\u09cd\u099a\u09bf\u09ae\u09ac\u0999\u09cd\u0997 P\u00f4shchimb\u00f4ngg\u00f4). This is the native name of the state, literally meaning \"western Bengal\" in the native Bengali language. In August 2016 the West Bengal Legislative Assembly passed another resolution to change the name of West Bengal to \"Bengal\" in English and \"Bangla\" in Bengali. Despite the Trinamool Congress government's efforts to forge a consensus on the name change resolution, the Indian National Congress, the Left Front and the Bharatiya Janata Party opposed the resolution. However, the central government has turned down the proposal maintaining the state should have one single name for all languages instead of three and it should not be the same as that of any other territory (pointing out that the name 'Bangla' may create confusion with neighbouring Bangladesh).\n\n\n== History ==", "start_char_idx": 4857, "end_char_idx": 6858, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b1800bd-188b-406c-a966-802b58cefca7": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b1800bd-188b-406c-a966-802b58cefca7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/West_Bengal.txt", "file_name": "West_Bengal.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58431, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d7f72a5-2ba8-4051-9b66-6e5ef7054c1d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/West_Bengal.txt", "file_name": "West_Bengal.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58431, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "af0334d6f61b3dfda24f3fa846b1dfe723ae9e9dbce2cf1d36a6b6f97c5fa3ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "30510b57-0c36-4d24-8d43-df2ccccd7889", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/West_Bengal.txt", "file_name": "West_Bengal.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58431, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "823763b913ca82425ec321b84d271a08438cb32866162164608166da2cef09ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "01797479-72e7-46d4-9570-c1b26f4a03a2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "114d56f7ddd1c067b4303ccc30640def70d1702cfc622503b040233701f4e6bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient and classical period ===\nStone Age tools dating back 20,000 years have been excavated in the state, showing human occupation 8,000 years earlier than scholars had thought. According to the Indian epic Mahabharata the region was part of the Vanga Kingdom. Several Vedic realms were present in the Bengal region, including Vanga, Rarh, Pundravardhana and the Suhma Kingdom. One of the earliest foreign references to Bengal is a mention by the Ancient Greeks around 100 BCE of a land named Gangaridai located at the mouths of the Ganges. Bengal had overseas trade relations with Suvarnabhumi (Burma, Lower Thailand, the Lower Malay Peninsula and Sumatra). According to the Sri Lankan chronicle Mahavamsa, Prince Vijaya (c.\u2009543 \u2013 c.\u2009505 BCE), a Vanga Kingdom prince, conquered Lanka (modern-day Sri Lanka) and named the country Sinhala Kingdom.The kingdom of Magadha was formed in the 7th century BCE, consisting of the regions now comprising Bihar and Bengal. It was one of the four main kingdoms of India at the time of the lives of Mahavira, the principal figure of Jainism and Gautama Buddha, founder of Buddhism. It consisted of several janapadas, or kingdoms. Under Ashoka, the Maurya Empire of Magadha in the 3rd century BCE extended over nearly all of South Asia, including Afghanistan and parts of Balochistan. From the 3rd to the 6th centuries CE, the kingdom of Magadha served as the seat of the Gupta Empire.\nTwo kingdoms\u2014Vanga or Samatata, and Gauda\u2014are said in some texts to have appeared after the end of the Gupta Empire although details of their ascendancy are uncertain. The first recorded independent king of Bengal was Shashanka, who reigned in the early 7th century. Shashanka is often recorded in Buddhist annals as an intolerant Hindu ruler noted for his persecution of the Buddhists. He murdered Rajyavardhana, the Buddhist king of Thanesar, and is noted for destroying the Bodhi tree at Bodhgaya, and replacing Buddha statues with Shiva lingams. After a period of anarchy,:\u200a36\u200a the Pala dynasty ruled the region for four hundred years beginning in the 8th century. A shorter reign of the Hindu Sena dynasty followed.Rajendra Chola I of the Chola dynasty invaded some areas of Bengal between 1021 and 1023.Islam was introduced through trade with the Abbasid Caliphate. Following the Ghurid conquests led by Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji and the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate, it spread across the entire Bengal region. Mosques, madrasas and khanqahs were built throughout these stages. During the Islamic Bengal Sultanate, founded in 1352, Bengal was a major world trading nation and was often referred by the Europeans as the richest country with which to trade.

It was ruled by dynasties of the Bengal Sultanate and feudal lords under the Delhi Sultanate for the next few hundred years. The Bengal Sultanate was interrupted for twenty years by a Hindu uprising under Raja Ganesha. In the 16th century, Mughal general Islam Khan conquered Bengal. Administration by governors appointed by the court of the Mughal Empire gave way to semi-independence under the Nawabs of Murshidabad, who nominally respected the sovereignty of the Mughals in Delhi. Several independent Hindu states were established in Bengal during the Mughal period, including those of Pratapaditya of Jessore District and Raja Sitaram Ray of Bardhaman. Following the death of Emperor Aurangzeb and the Governor of Bengal, Shaista Khan, the proto-industrialised Mughal Bengal became a semi-independent state under the Nawabs of Bengal, and showed signs of the world's first Industrial revolution.  The Koch dynasty in northern Bengal flourished during the 16th and 17th centuries; it weathered the Mughals and survived until the advent of the British colonial era.\n\n\n=== Colonial period ===\nSeveral European traders reached this area in the late 15th century. The British East India Company defeated Siraj ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab, in the Battle of Plassey in 1757. The company gained the right to collect revenue in Bengal subah (province) in 1765 with the signing of the treaty between the East India company and the Mughal emperor following the Battle of Buxar in 1764. The Bengal Presidency was established in 1765; it later incorporated all British-controlled territory north of the Central Provinces (now Madhya Pradesh), from the mouths of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra to the Himalayas and the Punjab. The Bengal famine of 1770 claimed millions of lives due to tax policies enacted by the British company. Calcutta, the headquarters of the East India company, was named the capital of British-held territories in India in 1773. The failed Indian rebellion of 1857 started near Calcutta and resulted in a transfer of authority to the British Crown, administered by the Viceroy of India.\nThe Bengal Renaissance and the Brahmo Samaj socio-cultural reform movements significantly influenced the cultural and economic life of Bengal. Between 1905 and 1911 an abortive attempt was made to divide the province of Bengal into two zones. Bengal suffered from the Great Bengal famine in 1943, which claimed three million lives during World War II. Bengalis played a major role in the Indian independence movement, in which revolutionary groups such as Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar were dominant.

The western part went to the Dominion of India and was named West Bengal. The eastern part went to the Dominion of Pakistan as a province called East Bengal (later renamed East Pakistan in 1956), becoming the independent nation of Bangladesh in 1971. In 1950 the Princely State of Cooch Behar merged with West Bengal. In 1955 the former French enclave of Chandannagar, which had passed into Indian control after 1950, was integrated into West Bengal; portions of Bihar were also subsequently merged with West Bengal. Both West and East Bengal experienced large influxes of refugees during and after the partition in 1947. Refugee resettlement and related issues continued to play a significant role in the politics and socio-economic condition of the state.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, severe power shortages, strikes and a violent Marxist\u2013Maoist movement by groups known as the Naxalites damaged much of the city's infrastructure, leading to a period of economic stagnation and deindustrialisation. The Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 resulted in an influx of millions of refugees to West Bengal, causing significant strains on its infrastructure. The 1974 smallpox epidemic killed thousands. West Bengal politics underwent a major change when the Left Front won the 1977 assembly election, defeating the incumbent Indian National Congress. The Left Front, led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), governed the state for the next three decades.The state's economic recovery gathered momentum after the central government introduced economic liberalisations in the mid-1990s. This was aided by the advent of information technology and IT-enabled services. Beginning in the mid-2000s, armed activists conducted minor terrorist attacks in some parts of the state. Clashes with the administration took place at several controversial locations over the issue of industrial land acquisition. This became a decisive reason behind the defeat of the ruling Left Front government in the 2011 assembly election. Although the economy was severely damaged during the unrest in the 1970s, the state has managed to revive its economy steadily throughout the years. The state has shown improvement regarding bandhs (strikes) and educational infrastructure. Significant strides have been made in reducing unemployment, though the state suffers from substandard healthcare services, a lack of socio-economic development, poor infrastructure, unemployment and civil violence.

The state has a total area of 88,752 square kilometres (34,267 sq mi). The Darjeeling Himalayan hill region in the northern extreme of the state is a part of the eastern Himalayas mountain range. In this region is Sandakfu, which, at 3,636 m (11,929 ft), is the highest peak in the state. The narrow Terai region separates the hills from the North Bengal plains, which in turn transitions into the Ganges delta towards the south. The Rarh region intervenes between the Ganges delta in the east and the western plateau and high lands. A small coastal region is in the extreme south, while the Sundarbans mangrove forests form a geographical landmark at the Ganges delta.The main river in West Bengal is the Ganges, which divides into two branches. One branch enters Bangladesh as the Padma, or P\u00f4dda, while the other flows through West Bengal as the Bhagirathi River and Hooghly River. The Farakka barrage over the Ganges feeds the Hooghly branch of the river by a feeder canal. Its water flow management has been a source of lingering dispute between India and Bangladesh. The Teesta, Torsa, Jaldhaka and Mahananda rivers are in the northern hilly region. The western plateau region has rivers like the Damodar, Ajay and Kangsabati. The Ganges delta and the Sundarbans area have numerous rivers and creeks. Pollution of the Ganges from indiscriminate waste dumped into the river is a major problem. Damodar, another tributary of the Ganges and once known as the \"Sorrow of Bengal\" (due to its frequent floods), has several dams under the Damodar Valley Project. At least nine districts in the state suffer from arsenic contamination of groundwater, and as of 2017 an estimated 1.04 crore people were afflicted by arsenic poisoning.West Bengal's climate varies from tropical savanna in the southern portions to humid subtropical in the north. The main seasons are summer, the rainy season, a short autumn and winter. While the summer in the delta region is noted for excessive humidity, the western highlands experience a dry summer like northern India. The highest daytime temperatures range from 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) to 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F). At night, a cool southerly breeze carries moisture from the Bay of Bengal. In early summer, brief squalls and thunderstorms known as Kalbaisakhi, or Nor'westers, often occur. West Bengal receives the Bay of Bengal branch of the Indian Ocean monsoon that moves in a southeast to northwest direction. Monsoons bring rain to the whole state from June to September. Heavy rainfall of above 250 centimetres (98 in) is observed in the Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, and Cooch Behar district. During the arrival of the monsoons, low pressure in the Bay of Bengal region often leads to the formation of storms in the coastal areas. Winter (December\u2013January) is mild over the plains with average minimum temperatures of 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F). A cold and dry northern wind blows in the winter, substantially lowering the humidity level. The Darjeeling Himalayan Hill region experiences a harsh winter, with occasional snowfall.", "start_char_idx": 15300, "end_char_idx": 18479, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f164454-c636-4a77-ad3e-86e0582cfd9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f164454-c636-4a77-ad3e-86e0582cfd9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/West_Bengal.txt", "file_name": "West_Bengal.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58431, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d7f72a5-2ba8-4051-9b66-6e5ef7054c1d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/West_Bengal.txt", "file_name": "West_Bengal.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58431, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "af0334d6f61b3dfda24f3fa846b1dfe723ae9e9dbce2cf1d36a6b6f97c5fa3ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2ea813c5-eb62-44a4-a39a-ba463e39dc34", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/West_Bengal.txt", "file_name": "West_Bengal.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58431, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "767fa01e345b18f8f029acfa823be753d14e48d938f3298803b4f7076a18324a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "efd0c8b1-1f85-4bfd-a0b8-9541ddee3f2a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4acd130d142dfd44fc0c386f97eb19b1385dafafa3169c0e33b18a4e92b2186d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Flora and fauna ===\n\nThe \"India State of Forest Report 2017\", recorded forest area in the state is 16,847 km2 (6,505 sq mi), while in 2013, forest area was 16,805 km2 (6,488 sq mi), which was 18.93% of the state's geographical area, compared to the then national average of 21.23%. Reserves and protected and unclassed forests constitute 59.4%, 31.8% and 8.9%, respectively, of forested areas, as of 2009. Part of the world's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans in southern West Bengal.From a phytogeographic viewpoint, the southern part of West Bengal can be divided into two regions: the Gangetic plain and the littoral mangrove forests of the Sundarbans. The alluvial soil of the Gangetic plain, combined with favourable rainfall, makes this region especially fertile. Much of the vegetation of the western part of the state has similar species composition with the plants of the Chota Nagpur plateau in the adjoining state of Jharkhand. The predominant commercial tree species is Shorea robusta, commonly known as the sal tree. The coastal region of Purba Medinipur exhibits coastal vegetation; the predominant tree is the Casuarina. A notable tree from the Sundarbans is the ubiquitous sundari (Heritiera fomes), from which the forest gets its name.The distribution of vegetation in northern West Bengal is dictated by elevation and precipitation. For example, the foothills of the Himalayas, the Dooars, are densely wooded with sal and other tropical evergreen trees. Above an elevation of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft), the forest becomes predominantly subtropical. In Darjeeling, which is above 1,500 metres (4,900 ft), temperate forest trees like oaks, conifers and rhododendrons predominate.3.26% of the geographical area of West Bengal is protected land, comprising fifteen wildlife sanctuaries and five national parks\u2014Sundarbans National Park, Buxa Tiger Reserve, Gorumara National Park, Neora Valley National Park and Singalila National Park. Extant wildlife includes Indian rhinoceros, Indian elephant, deer, leopard, gaur, tiger and crocodiles, as well as many bird species. Migratory birds come to the state during the winter. The high-altitude forests of Singalila National Park shelter barking deer, red panda, chinkara, takin, serow, pangolin, minivet and kalij pheasants. The Sundarbans are noted for a reserve project devoted to conserving the endangered Bengal tiger, although the forest hosts many other endangered species such as the Gangetic dolphin, river terrapin and estuarine crocodile. The mangrove forest also acts as a natural fish nursery, supporting coastal fishes along the Bay of Bengal.

Universal suffrage is granted to residents. There are two branches of government. The legislature, the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, who are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker's absence. The judiciary is composed of the Calcutta High Court and a system of lower courts. Executive authority is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister although the titular head of government is the Governor. The Governor is the Head of State appointed by the President of India. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the Governor. The Council of Ministers is appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly is unicameral with 295 members, or MLAs, including one nominated from the Anglo-Indian community. Terms of office run for five years unless the Assembly is dissolved before the completion of the term. Auxiliary authorities known as panchayats, for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs. The state contributes 42 seats to the Lok Sabha and 16 seats to the Rajya Sabha of the Indian Parliament.Politics in West Bengal is dominated by the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Indian National Congress (INC), and the Left Front alliance (led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M)). Following the West Bengal State Assembly Election in 2011, the All India Trinamool Congress and Indian National Congress coalition under Mamata Banerjee of the All India Trinamool Congress was elected to power with 225 seats in the legislature.Prior to this, West Bengal was ruled by the Left Front for 34 years (1977\u20132011), making it the world's longest-running democratically elected communist government. Banerjee was re-elected twice as Chief Minister in the 2016 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election and 2021 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election with 211 and 215 seats respectively, an absolute majority by the Trinamool Congress.

The Durgapur-Asansol colliery belt is home to a number of steel plants. Important manufacturing industries include: engineering products, electronics, electrical equipment, cables, steel, leather, textiles, jewellery, frigates, automobiles, railway coaches and wagons. The Durgapur centre has established several industries in the areas of tea, sugar, chemicals and fertilisers. Natural resources like tea and jute in nearby areas have made West Bengal a major centre for the jute and tea industries.Years after independence, West Bengal is dependent on the central government for help in meeting its demands for food; food production remained stagnant, and the Indian green revolution bypassed the state.

West Bengal has a long tradition of folk literature, evidenced by the Charyapada, a collection of Buddhist mystic songs dating back to the 10th and 11th centuries; Mangalkavya, a collection of Hindu narrative poetry composed around the 13th century; Shreekrishna Kirtana, a pastoral Vaishnava drama in verse composed by Boru Chandidas; Thakurmar Jhuli, a collection of Bengali folk and fairy tales compiled by Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumder; and stories of Gopal Bhar, a court jester in medieval Bengal. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Bengali literature was modernised in the works of authors such as Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, whose works marked a departure from the traditional verse-oriented writings prevalent in that period; Michael Madhusudan Dutt, a pioneer in Bengali drama who introduced the use of blank verse; and Rabindranath Tagore, who reshaped Bengali literature and music. Indian art saw the introduction of Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Other notable figures include Kazi Nazrul Islam, whose compositions form the avant-garde genre of Nazrul Sangeet, Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, whose works on contemporary social practices in Bengal are widely acclaimed, and Manik Bandyopadhyay, who is considered one of the leading lights of modern Bengali fiction. In modern times, Jibanananda Das has been acknowledged as \"the premier poet of the post-Tagore era in India\". Other writers include: Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay, best known for his work Pather Panchali; Tarashankar Bandopadhyay, well known for his portrayal of the lower strata of society; Manik Bandopadhyay, a pioneering novelist; and Ashapurna Devi, Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay, Saradindu Bandopadhyay, Buddhadeb Guha, Mahashweta Devi, Samaresh Majumdar, Sanjeev Chattopadhyay, Shakti Chattopadhyay, Buddhadeb Basu, Joy Goswami and Sunil Gangopadhyay.\n\n\n=== Music and dance ===\n\nA notable music tradition is the Baul music, practised by the Bauls, a sect of mystic minstrels. Other folk music forms include Gombhira and Bhawaiya. Folk music in West Bengal is often accompanied by the ektara, a one-stringed instrument. Shyama Sangeet is a genre of devotional songs, praising the Hindu goddess Kali; kirtan is devotional group songs dedicated to the god Krishna. Like other states in northern India, West Bengal also has a heritage in North Indian classical music. Rabindrasangeet, songs composed and set to words by Rabindranath Tagore, and Nazrul geeti (by Kazi Nazrul Islam) are popular. Also prominent are Dwijendralal, Atulprasad and Rajanikanta's songs, and adhunik or modern music from films and other composers. From the early 1990s, new genres of music have emerged, including what has been called Bengali Jeebonmukhi Gaan (a modern genre based on realism). Bengali dance forms draw from folk traditions, especially those of the tribal groups, as well as the broader Indian dance traditions. Chhau dance of Purulia is a rare form of masked dance.", "start_char_idx": 36377, "end_char_idx": 39466, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "842ddf64-d114-4bf8-a17e-784bd21909f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "842ddf64-d114-4bf8-a17e-784bd21909f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/West_Bengal.txt", "file_name": "West_Bengal.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58431, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d7f72a5-2ba8-4051-9b66-6e5ef7054c1d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/West_Bengal.txt", "file_name": "West_Bengal.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58431, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "af0334d6f61b3dfda24f3fa846b1dfe723ae9e9dbce2cf1d36a6b6f97c5fa3ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "df5209c6-3153-4d90-980b-5509d09feeef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/West_Bengal.txt", "file_name": "West_Bengal.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58431, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "9559b8f185464d23b2417630d5879d94ca3c9b1437804c9f667a045ab0653789", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f7ce61aa-d44e-4dc6-8c1a-d4b6b1ac3e07", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f66bc2b8be31d8691f6bd3d709502ae77b8d103f77c2f38e488936c2e7c54928", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Films ===\n\nWest Bengali films are shot mostly in studios in the Kolkata neighbourhood of Tollygunge; the name \"Tollywood\" (similar to Hollywood and Bollywood) is derived from that name. The Bengali film industry is well known for its art films, and has produced acclaimed directors like Satyajit Ray who is widely regarded as one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century, Mrinal Sen whose films were known for their artistic depiction of social reality, Tapan Sinha, and Ritwik Ghatak. Some contemporary directors include veterans such as: Buddhadeb Dasgupta, Tarun Majumdar, Goutam Ghose, Aparna Sen, and Rituparno Ghosh, and a newer pool of directors such as Kaushik Ganguly and Srijit Mukherji. Uttam Kumar was the most popular lead actor for decades, and his romantic pairing with actress Suchitra Sen in films attained legendary status. Soumitra Chatterjee, who acted in many Satyajit Ray-films, and Prosenjit Chatterjee are among other popular lead male actors. As of 2020, Bengali films have won India's annual National Film Award for Best Feature Film twenty-two times in sixty seven years, the highest among all Indian languages.\n\n\n=== Fine arts ===\nThere are significant examples of fine arts in Bengal from earlier times, including the terracotta art of Hindu temples and the Kalighat paintings. Bengal has been in the vanguard of modernism in fine arts. Abanindranath Tagore, called the father of modern Indian art, started the Bengal School of Art, one of whose goals was to promote the development of styles of art outside the European realist tradition that had been taught in art colleges under the British colonial administration. The movement had many adherents, including: Gaganendranath Tagore, Ramkinkar Baij, Jamini Roy and Rabindranath Tagore. After Indian Independence, important groups such as the Calcutta Group and the Society of Contemporary Artists were formed in Bengal and came to dominate the art scene in India.\n\n\n=== Reformist heritage ===\nThe capital, Kolkata, was the workplace of several social reformers, including Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar and Swami Vivekananda. Their social reforms eventually led to a cultural atmosphere that made it possible for practices like sati, dowry, and caste-based discrimination, or untouchability, to be abolished. The region was also home to several religious teachers, such as Chaitanya, Ramakrishna, Prabhupada and Paramahansa Yogananda.", "start_char_idx": 39469, "end_char_idx": 41908, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7ce61aa-d44e-4dc6-8c1a-d4b6b1ac3e07": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7ce61aa-d44e-4dc6-8c1a-d4b6b1ac3e07", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/West_Bengal.txt", "file_name": "West_Bengal.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58431, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d7f72a5-2ba8-4051-9b66-6e5ef7054c1d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/West_Bengal.txt", "file_name": "West_Bengal.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58431, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "af0334d6f61b3dfda24f3fa846b1dfe723ae9e9dbce2cf1d36a6b6f97c5fa3ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "842ddf64-d114-4bf8-a17e-784bd21909f3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "India_States_UT/West_Bengal.txt", "file_name": "West_Bengal.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58431, "creation_date": "2024-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-22"}, "hash": "8ba06aa2fab7dbd09babba380b6cfc00b32259eee1aa9508c0d34ac6bad03ca0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "caf0dba5-2f41-406b-9a9c-055670f17aef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1a2bfcfeb5f1035086f459deecd890de740bb675ece1dee6ad781ed670d8aa9f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Cuisine ===\n\nRice and fish are traditional favourite foods, leading to a saying in Bengali, \"machhe bhate bangali\", that translates as \"fish and rice make a Bengali\". Bengal's vast repertoire of fish-based dishes includes hilsa preparations, a favourite among Bengalis. There are numerous ways of cooking fish depending on its texture, size, fat content and bones. Most of the people also consume eggs, chicken, mutton, and shrimp. Panta bhat (rice soaked overnight in water) with onion and green chili is a traditional dish consumed in rural areas. Common spices found in a Bengali kitchen include cumin, ajmoda (radhuni), bay leaf, mustard, ginger, green chillies and turmeric. Sweets occupy an important place in the diet of Bengalis and at their social ceremonies. Bengalis make distinctive sweetmeats from milk products, including R\u00f4shogolla, Ch\u00f4mch\u00f4m, Kalojam and several kinds of sondesh. Pitha, a kind of sweet cake, bread, or dim sum, are specialties of the winter season. Sweets such as narkol-naru, til-naru, moa and payesh are prepared during festivals such as Lakshmi puja. Popular street foods include Aloor Chop, Beguni, Kati roll, biryani, and phuchka.\n\n\n=== Clothing ===\nBengali women commonly wear the sari, often distinctly designed according to local cultural customs. In urban areas, many women and men wear western attire. Among men, western dress has greater acceptance. Particularly on cultural occasions, men also wear traditional costumes such as the panjabi with dhuti while women wear salwar kameez or sari.West Bengal produces several varieties of cotton and silk saris in the country. Handlooms are a popular way for the state's rural population to earn a living through weaving. Every district has weaving clusters, which are home to artisan communities, each specialising in specific varieties of handloom weaving. Notable handloom saris include tant, jamdani, garad, korial, baluchari, tussar and muslin.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nDurga Puja is the biggest, most popular and widely celebrated festival in West Bengal. The five-day-long colourful Hindu festival includes intense celebration across the state. Pandals are erected in various cities, towns, and villages throughout West Bengal. The city of Kolkata transforms Durga Puja. It is decked up in lighting decorations and thousands of colourful pandals are set up where effigies of the goddess Durga and her four children are displayed and worshipped. The idols of the goddess are brought in from Kumortuli, where idol-makers work throughout the year fashioning clay models of the goddess. Since independence in 1947, Durga Puja has slowly changed into more of a glamorous carnival than a religious festival. Today people of diverse religious and ethnic backgrounds partake in the festivities. On Vijayadashami, the last day of the festival, the effigies are paraded through the streets with riotous pageantry before being immersed into the rivers.Rath Yatra is a Hindu festival which celebrates Jagannath, a form of Krishna. It is celebrated with much fanfare in Kolkata as well as in rural Bengal.

Just like Durga Puja, Christmas in Kolkata is an occasion when all communities and people of every religion take part. Large masses of people go to parks, gardens, museums, parties, fairs, churches and other places to celebrate the day. A lot of Hindus go to Hindu-temples and the festival is celebrated there too with Hindu rituals. The state tourism department organises a gala Christmas Festival every year in Park Street. The whole of Park Street is hung with colourful lights, and food stalls sell cakes, chocolates, Chinese cuisine, momo, and various other items. The state invites musical groups from Darjeeling and other North East India states to perform choir recitals, carols, and jazz numbers.Buddha Purnima, which marks the birth of Gautama Buddha, is one of the most important Hindu/Buddhist festivals and is celebrated with much gusto in the Darjeeling hills. On this day, processions begin at the various Buddhist monasteries, or gumpas, and congregate at the Chowrasta (Darjeeling) Mall. The Lamas chant mantras and sound their bugles, and students, as well as people from every community, carry the holy books or pustaks on their heads. Besides Buddha Purnima, Dashain, or Dusshera, Holi, Diwali, Losar, Namsoong or the Lepcha New Year, and Losoong are the other major festivals of the Darjeeling Himalayan region.Each year between July and August (on the eve of the month of Shravan) in Tarakeswar Yatra held, nearly 10 million devotees come from various part of India bringing holy water of Ganga from Nimai Tirtha Ghat of Baidyabati, which is almost 39 km (25 mi) from Tarakeswar, in order to offer it to Lord Shiva.
